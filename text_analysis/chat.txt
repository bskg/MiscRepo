Grew up in a big catholic family, sort of the odd one out I think. Hated school, got bullied. Really sensitive kid. Still sensitive now. Went to a good college, wanted to do computer stuff because he was really good at it, but his dad told him that computers were a fad and he should pursue engineering. He's still mad about that. Had the same job his whole life.

It was a good childhood. So much room to explore, so much freedom. But responsibilities as well, milking the goats etc. And danger! Mountain lions and rattlesnakes mostly. I like the country because it forces you into life, there's no other option.
Plus, all of our neighbors were rocket scientists or college professors, so they were good people.
I used to petsit for them for pocket money.
And riding! I loved that. My mom taught me so much about horses and animal behavior.

I might have projected myself onto you too much
But for most of my life, my thought has been primarily semantic, verbal
and I didn't feel my body very much, in retrospect
and I always found it cumbersome that reality is usually too messy to apply theories directly
it was one of the great discoveries of my life when I started reversing this
but I still strive towards generalities, which is kindof pure spirit
if spirit is something like pure meaning, pure form without substance
a lot of my philosophical interests are in direct reaction to this imbalance in myself

weir 12-Aug-20 07:19 PM
the country kept me healthy without any conscious effort on my part. I wasn't a "sports" kid. I just liked doing stuff. Climbing trees and riding and running with the goats. Playing outside all day.
But even with all of that distraction, I read constantly. Daily. Always in my head, daydreams and plans and ponderings.
Moving to the city was hard because I had to make plans for myself to do things that just happened accidentally before. Exercise and fresh air.
I never get to lie there and look at the stars anymore. They are so dull in the city.
I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself well. I think we are the same type, but raised differently.

Debauched. A man who seeks to understand something. Does something he knows is wrong, not because it brings pleasure, but because it hurts.
whereas, the pervert doesn't know, or doesn't care. does it for the pleasure.
you dabble in filth, but you are not filth. Insusceptible.
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Aug-20 07:33 PM
This is a useful framework
But debauchery always includes perversion I think
it's to give in to perversion, in order to suffer some kind of pain as you say
but it's ambiguous
am I simply justifying perversion by putting a self-aware spin on it?
Or is it a kind of purgation

It's enough that you know a little. He blew up a government block and shot about 70 teenage politicans in training on an island. The whole country was watching live for hours while it was ongoing
Kids were swimming across the lake to shore, trying to escape
The special police was shown to be completely incompetent
They tried to cross in a boat but their equipment was too heavy and they had to turn back
He was allowed to go on until he simply decided to surrender
I think really great art reminds you that your sense of safety is false
that there is no society
that your walls will decay and the electricity will fail and the water might be poisoned
it's just you and nature

some fighter pilots are real jerks though. Heard one bragging about how they used to do fly-bys of this guy's turkey farm for fun, to hear em gobble and how a bunch of them died from stress and the farmer sent the bill to his boss.
Probably being low on empathy is a good thing to have in that sort of work though.
It wasn't just the turkeys. Also claimed to have stampeded a herd of cows into a frozen lake.

It's kind of the wee hours here and I'm between sleep. I remembered something from a few years ago that I wanted to tell you. Mixed metaphors. They used to delight me. The cat who got the cream and the cat who ate the canary both concern the same thing, smugness. For some reason I took them and thought of this: the canary ate the cream. Turning them inside out. I think there were others but that's the one I remember right now. And once I had a migraine coming, the aura took shape and I couldn't see right. Everything was too bright, and I went to tell my mom (out in the garden) that I would be incapcitated for a few hours. The sun outside was blinding and I remember watching this spider crawl across the ground in my peripheral vison. For some reason the aura state caused it to look like it was moving in stop motion, like an old film, even though it wasn't visually obscured by the aura patch. Makes me think of your framerate, just thematically. I hope your day is going well. Yesterday was a busy one for me. I think I'll try to sleep a few more hours before dawn.

My day and the past days have been very good, but subdued. I'm heavy, lots of resistance to doing things, but little ideas come regularly and they are compounding. I will explode and take off like a rocket soon
I think the notion of "manifesting" or making things real by imagining them reveals something deep about the human mind, although I don't believe in it as supernatural phenomenon
My nephew got a toy harmonica. My sister showed him how to make sound by blowing through it. When he tried, he simply held it to his mouth and made a similar high-pitch sound with his voice
Really funny, but I think this is how we always go about trying to do new things
Avatar
weir 14-Aug-20 01:41 PM
That is really funny. Very, very cute, made me smile. Later comes holding the harmonica between the teeth and running around breathing like a mechanical dragon, all one set of notes. I do think that's how we try new things, especially when we are small and have so little context for most things. Everything is new without context. I remember doing several things in such a way. One of my very early memories is going with my dad to his barbershop for his haircut appointment. They had one of those huge red and white and blue barbershop poles outside the door. I was probably mid-three? They gave me a piece of bubblegum as we were leaving, I think they gave candy to all the kids. I remember I only got halfway to the car before I accidentally spat it out trying to blow a bubble through sheer force of air. Or learning to whistle. A lot of kids will purse their lips and sort of scream or hum, trying to force a whistle, but not really sure what a whistle is.
This made me laugh, gloriously unhelpful map of the sea from the hunting of the snark

I know he was, I looked him up a ling time ago. I love his alice in wonderland and through the looking glass precisely for what they do not contain. The actual reading of them is sometimes dull, but the remembering of them is never as dull as the reading. I think he knew this, and I respect him for it. Of course there is lots of sense to be found in his books as well, but the main attraction is the nonsense.
There is a quote from Alice, regarding the poem of the Jabberwocky that sums up Nonsense very nicely. That's why I think he knew exactly what he was doing.

bjorn96 14-Aug-20 08:02 PM
There are actually two obstacles to the classical notion of understanding
the first is that some systems are so efficient e.g. so meaningful that any explanation is equally or more complex than the system itself
the other is that perception usually entails an interaction that changes the system
in both cases, interaction (or rather participation) is only possible by blurring the line between observer and observed
the latter is why people talk about "quantum weirdness"
but it applies just as much in introspection, even large scale collective introspection (philosophy of mind and existence, psychology)

In this case, it primarily refers to the fact that there are particles so light that you can't know their location and their momentum simultaneously. I don't understand this literature in any deep way yet, but this is roughly it.

I wonder about the relationship between food, physical substances on one hand and health, mentality on the other
Including both alternative and mainstream medicine approaches
I suspect that to a large extent, healing is a mental process of restructuring, but physical objects like pills or diets are a sort of aid to cognition
Going through a ritual of eating a pill every morning helps a mental healing process the same way as writing words and sentences helps thought
But then there are clearly also direct physical effects

That sounds very familiar, in a way. I've come to think there are creative cycles, for both artistic/intuitive and the more logical/reasoned out stuff. I don't always write, but when I do it's because I have something I need to get down.
My artistic cycles are more erratic, I think. I build fairly steadily with ideas. Some days there is nothing, it's quiet. I think there is a waning and waxing.

gathering data is like taking in nutrition. Thinking is like digestion. Talking to others helps thinking like walking helps digestion. You'll still digest the food if you lie down the whole time, but it will be less efficient and maybe make you feel sick

Perhaps not all at once, I could probably just go by whichever looks the nicest, but usually there is an order, a backlog of which ones I want to pick next.

domain. peripheral, background. Mother's domain, but not mother. I think there is a difference between entity and domain, if you can call a piece of your mind an entity.
Like, motherliness deals with the peripheral, the intuitive. But it is present at a specific area of focus.

Same with the other side, obviously. Entity is like where the focus is. Usually it's on an idea.
this is rough, it's kinda visual. a lot of my metaphors are visual.
by rough I mean imprecise
Avatar
bjorn96 14-Aug-20 09:47 PM
this is related to our discussion about drops containing an ocean made of drops
the ocean refers to domain and drop to entity
In cognitive semantics they are called figure-ground
or landmark-trajector in the case of movement
I think moving an entity to a new domain is one example of a shift
but it can just as easily be the creation of a new entity, a new domain, a new interaction between entities in a domain
etc
a new correspondence between domains
which is what we usually call metaphor
Avatar
weir 14-Aug-20 09:50 PM
yes good point, only one example of a shift. I'm glad that there are words for this already, I will look them up when you go.

so in the juxtaposition, it's always "the same time" for both
including the moment when they meet
I'm making it more complicated than it is
Avatar
weir 14-Aug-20 10:01 PM
variable, it said but if they are both walking in opposing directions, there will be many space-passings, but one of them will also be a time-passing. which is the passing that I see.

I'll understand you
We can take more specific examples to elucidate it
Say on the way up, he walks in a completely even tempo the whole way
and same on the way down
then they'll clearly be at the same point (half way up) after half the day has passed
right?

Now if on the way down he stays near the top until one hour is left, then runs down

I just didn't start with the assumption that they would be going the same speed. Oh good, they aren't.
The passing.

bjorn96 14-Aug-20 10:04 PM
No, they can go at any speed, but they start and end at the same time
Avatar
weir 14-Aug-20 10:05 PM
There would be a passing, if one were to run down. and that would be both time and space.
Something I can see, but still not sure I can reason out clearly. You're better at that than me.
Avatar
bjorn96 14-Aug-20 10:07 PM
They start at the same time. At any moment throughout the day, if you choose to pause, the same amount of time has elapsed for both.
If they both reach their respective destination at the same time, at the end of the day, they must pass in space.
Pause at the moment when they pass
We have already shown that the same amount of time has elapsed for both at any moment you pause, including this moment
so at the moment when they meet in space, they also meet in time
Once you juxtapose the two days, so they start at the same time, it is already implicit that they meet in time, at every moment through the day

It shows that metaphor is not a literary device, or some poetic conceit

huh
cause I'm thinking about the notion that

heaviness is amount of matter

maybe

mass is latency I understand, now I do. I told you I think a little slowly, but I turn things over until they make sense.
is distance the same as slowness thinking about it we experience them similarly
inextricable slowness I read "time elapsed?" is this correct?
Avatar
bjorn96 14-Aug-20 10:30 PM
not only
btw slowness feels like it's not a proper word

but let's use it
slowness is time elapsed, it's also stability, duration that knowledge stays true about a thing
especially about its location

"slowness" does seem like it's in the wrong form. but I can work with it as a placeholder.
stability. this is important.

framerate?
Avatar
bjorn96 14-Aug-20 10:34 PM
it's related to it
we could think of entities as having their own framerate, at which they take in information and adjust to it
e.g. set themselves in motion after being hit
but this is quite shallow
seems like all matter has a "framerate" very high relative to human observers, and what we perceive as slowness is in fact a circular motion, stability exactly
so we can treat one frame as many frames
I'm thinking
slow things are distant from the center of the computational network underlying the physical universe
the center is where information is most liquid, most quickly available from anywhere in the network
in the periphery, the sum of information in the network is least available, most slowly reached
so heavy matter is distant from the center of the Becoming-network
light matter is near the center
or a center
there could be multiple
but heavy matter is just dense matter
so contraction is distance from center
and expansion is proximity to a center

but then, nodes of low centrality are more volatile, because a single change represents a larger proportion of the total input to the node. Central nodes will change more continuously, but their amplitude will be much greater. Gravity, forces is central. Discrete quantum stuff is peripheral.
Ok, end of that
I'm trying to fit a rather shallow understanding of physics, more focused on concepts than computations, into other domains
particularly the network domain
there are two big theories in physics. Both predict really impressively, but they are completely different and not reconciled

In Chinese, the colloquial name for Russia is ä¿„
which is pronounced "uh" with a rising intonation
It comes from the more formal Chinese word for Russia
ä¿„ç¾…æ–¯ uh-luo-si, of which the colloquial is the first character
now ä¿„ç¾…æ–¯ uh-luo-si is taken from classical mongolian
á £á¡µá £á °
oros
á £á¡µá £á ° (oros) is how the mongolians would pronounce the Russians' name for themselves, Rus
The mongolian language did not permit a syllable starting with R
so they added the initial o for purely phonetic reasons
but that o is what became the first character in ä¿„ç¾…æ–¯
which then become the whole word
So the word used in Chinese to mean Russia was just a phonetic artifact in Mongolian
Okay, this is even drier than I imagined
but I certainly entertained myself
so at least half the audience is happy

Avatar
bjorn96 15-Aug-20 02:37 AM
In principle, each word has its own character
in practice it's a bit more complicated
each character is made up of recurring building blocks
they suggest meaning and pronunciation. Can be good for remembering them, but you can't really decode it on its own
And in spoken Chinese most words will be two characters, two syllables. They might mean the same thing, or together specify the meaning
There are simply too many characters for each syllable, so speech would be too ambiguous if they didn't combine two for each word

We have a large chinese population (well, larger than I'm used to) here, because of the university. I don't interact with them much, but there are a lot of college kids here who are unusually wealthy for college kids.
Some of the girls from the community college told me that they throw away really high-end stuff when they graduate or go home for the summer, because they can't take it with them. Designer fashion is prevalent.

Funny that there can be so many species of a finch or something, that look exactly alike, eat the same things, but humans? All one race. I think it's a really fascinating area, wish there was more hard data, or aggregated hard data, on differences among groups.

I know more or less all the published data on race differences in brain structure. But that's because there's so little
And most of it is public "by accident"

There's brain size, gray matter volume, white matter volume, cranial capacity. All measures of the same thing.
And it's a thing that matter quite a lot. There is no controversy about this within neuroscience.
Brain size explains maybe 10% of the variance in intelligence. Maybe more. Small, but significant.
Africans do have significantly smaller brains. Although one particular structure is enlarged, the orbitofrontal cortex at the very front, bottom
Asians and Europeans are quite close, it seems like Asians have somewhat bigger brains, but it's really not clear.
What is certain is that their brains are bigger relative to their bodies
Then there's some more detailed stuff between Asians and Whites, that I have personally studied. I think it's important to understand cognitive differences and cultural differences between Asians and Whites.
personally studied, I mean, I have looked at the raw data and found this. It hasn't been written about. So should be treated with a bit more caution perhaps.

Asian brains are wide and short. European brains are long and narrow.
An Asian woman will typically have a broader brain than a white male
and conversely
white women's brains are longer than an Asian man's

This COULD be of no significance
but we know that there are functional and genetic gradients on both axes
frontal-back is an abstraction hierarchy, a temporal hierarchy
roughly
The front will have very abstract, long timeframe representations
Left to right is a different kind of gradient having to do with novelty and routine
It suggests that europeans have an advantage at abstraction, while Asians have an advantage at creating routines from data
There are also differences in the striatum, which is the "center" for habits, actions. To use the vulgar "center" terminology, but it's roughly true
It mirrors the length-breadth idea
The central part of the striatum is related to goal-directed actions
where the specific behavior is not specified, depends on the goal
This structure is larger in europeans
the lateral part is related to creating more fixed actions, routines, when the goal is less fluid
this part is larger in asians
It fits the stereotype that Asians are skilled at learning relatively well defined skills
and that Europeans are creative, harder to rule, less skilled at learning well defined domains

the amount of matter limits the connectivity, but ultimately what matters is the connectivity
g is
if you give a lot of people a lot of "mental tests"
any kind of test that involves thinking
then you find that all the tests are correlated
In general, no two tests that test some aspect of intelligence broadly defined, will have a negative correlation
then you can use statistical methods to extract factors
You might get a verbal factor and a spatial factor for example
meaning that some tests cluster together, people who do well on one tend to do well on all
and you can have many clusters, and then clusters of clusters
but there is always a general factor at the top
that is positively correlated to every cluster and every single test
and this is general intelligence

I'm sure it's an interesting field, but it never turned out to have major effects in the way popular culture made it out to be
it's just another convenient obstacle to clarity
About 80% of the variance in general intelligence is caused by differences in genes
that is, in inherited characteristics
About epigenetics, this is my impression

My mom talks about it a little in regards to health, genetic damage caused by diet etc. Maybe I'm mixed up.

bjorn96 15-Aug-20 03:33 AM
Yes, I think it is serious in that domain
what I mean is
the effects of things like epigenetics are mostly treated as environmental by the methods used to tease apart nature and nurture. So epigenetics could not inflate the estimate of what is inherited
So if something is shown to be "environmental", that could be in part epigenetic
but the environmental has been shown to be no more than 20% of the variance in the case of intelligence

On the other, a lot of my motivation for studying it came from the fact that it was a vehicle for adversarial politics and cultural debate
a way to own people

Avatar
weir 15-Aug-20 04:34 AM
you're probably right
I'm kind of cut off from meaningful data on what different peoples are like, so I form very broad and tentative guesses.
I think, for example, that people from russian areas tend towards blunt honesty, bordering on aggression. Americans do not do this, there is much superficial and absolutely dishonest politeness. But I don't know for sure to the extent this trend is real, and can from there only speculate wildly on the origins, whether it is cultural only, or genetic or what.
Avatar
bjorn96 15-Aug-20 04:38 AM
sounds familiar, but yeah
there are many layers before behavior
and the effects can be totally non-linear from layer to layer
being more aggressive genetically could lead to a culture that more supresses aggression, leading ultimately to less aggressive phenotype, just a made up example
but in principle
For example
Asians are probably way more susceptible to gambling addiction
and drug addiction
but they have evolved physical intolerance for drugs
and their societies are extremely hard on drugs, gambling too with notable exceptions
in consequence, Asians are certainly not thought of as drug addicts
but in terms of the psychological mechanism of addiction they are probably more susceptible in theory

I think it's that first generation works hard to get in and so being inside is valuable to them. It's a movement as you say
but to the kids, it's taken for granted
but I don't think playing the victim card is a natural consequence of alienation
I think theyre mostly just providing the supply, since there is a demand, so to speak
someone is willing to give them victim status so theyll take it

They consider themselves American. They bought a shiny thing, they swallowed it and it lives in them. A talisman. But the kids, and the grandkids, all they feel is the loss of a real culture.
It's just a trendy movement to fit in to
the victim thing
it could be any counterculture
but the point is, is that America is failing to provide a meaningful culture to it's youth, and not just the immigrant youth.

prejudice though
this word I guess can be valid, but is mostly used in a completely misleading way
it's the nature of things, that when meeting a new object you start out by classifying it very broadly based on similar objects youve interacted with
using whichever features have seemed to give most information in the past
and as you get to know the individual object, this kind of judgement by analogy is less influential
Avatar
weir 15-Aug-20 05:22 AM
absolutely valid in this regard there is a certain behavior among very low class whites in certain areas to adopt affected racism though, I think. I could be totally wrong, but I've met some people who do fit the "extremely stupid trailer trash" stereotype, which I can't really call racism, and it isn't prejudice either.
I'm not sure to what extent it's prevalent
it's a cultural thing

Campbell writes about common structures in myths and stories
An early stage is "the call of adventure"
something happens that signifies to the hero that he is no longer in the normal world, or that things are no longer predictable
he gives the example of the princess dropping her golden ball in a well
and a frog appears. Now the frog is a small reptilian

I wanted to say something earlier about Truth and Religion and I forgot
Religious dogmatists, including the contemporary political kind
Their approach to life and knowledge has clear validity in many situations, and makes sense.
When the central dogma is fresh, vital and "still true"
these people will flourish
and do good
and they will not waste their lives trying to oppose a dogma that is actually good and true
when the central dogma is no longer true, vital, etc
they are the recoil from braking too fast, something like that

it's a spectrum, roughly neuro-conservative to radical/intellectual/open. But neuro-conservative means "agreeing with professors, big corporations and government", not being politically conservative, which is now becoming a radical position
so the conservative type will hold social justice views because it is the status quo
the radical intellectual type will coalesce with earlier conservatives
or spin off in a totally different direction
You are an intellectual type, you are radical in the sense that you don't want to accept dogma or tradition, but think for yourself

Avatar
weir 15-Aug-20 06:07 AM
I think the essence of a visionary is the vision. A force of will, an ability to articulate well something that everyone can agree upon as a goal, as a very high goal. whether the crowd receives this, is partly the vision and partly the time and place. a spark. in a powderkeg, a damp one? or dry?

bjorn96 15-Aug-20 06:08 AM
yes, damp or dry
but the powderkeg
if a single grain is ignited, that grain is enough to blow up the rest
no matter which grain it is
or more generally, like in a nuclear reaction, you need a certain critical mass of "individuals"
but it doesn't have to be big
Avatar
weir 15-Aug-20 06:10 AM
that's the crowd. the crowd has this potential, always but a powder keg is volatile. perhaps a small fire is better, one that you are trying to light, kindling and fluff and matches and it needs protection until it is big enough to burn away the damp

Then the idea is completely used up

I was reading schopenhauer and he was talking about how pain is real and happiness an illusion, and I used to think that, but it isn't true. Pleasure is fleeting, but so is sensory pain, you can be chronically sad/pain or fulfilled/happy, both of these can last.
I've thought about it before though. Like with light, heat etc. How darkness and cold are just an absence. I don't know, is this the sort of thing you're talking about?

A pleasurable life is the wrong direction, because 1) it's too base, and 2) it's just a signal, not a direction, not a goal.
it's unreachable

weir 16-Aug-20 01:31 PM
because we're not here to be pleased, we're here to perform a function and pleasure, it just signals something low-level, base. It's nice, but it isn't GOOD, isn't THE good.
anyway
I don't have anything against pleasure, the point is just that it's not a thing on it's own. Not doing a great job explaining, but you probably understand, know already.

"Low-level, base" does not resonate with me. Neither does "we're not here to". I feel like those are incorrect construals of the situation. Explain them if you feel I am wrong. "Perform a function" I think is exactly right. "Not a thing on its own", yes.

weir 16-Aug-20 01:34 PM
low level okay, sugar, piece of cake. pleasing. simple reward circuit, no big judgements behind it.
other things, more complex things are also pleasing, but the reason they are pleasant is usually also low level. I think.
Easy to be tricked by it, because it is instinctive, unthinking. With more complex things, it is almost latent. We judge, say a conversation to be GOOD, or helpful in moving us towards a goal. Or college admission etc. We judge it as good, and then pleasure kicks in, belatedly, like a dog.
Could be wrong, but I've said enough about that.

He describes the commonalities of world mythologies and religions
from primitive tribes to large religions
There is a shared notion of a world navel, a center, often depicted as a tree or a pillar
And at this center of the world, all of time is connected
in a sense, time flows into the world through the center
It is very similar to what you said, but I never understood why

Displacement slows time
and blocks repetition
There are about three different conversations I would like to go into from here
I will outline them very shallowly and let you lead
1. The cortex, the most advanced 70% of the brain, is likely built up of "grid cells" and "displacement cells" coding centers, displacements and angles. All conceptual thought likely rests on this. 2. Pain is displacement, a stick in the wheel of time. It stops the desire to pursue. But does pain CAUSE these things, or is "pain" a label we put on these phenomena? An obstacle in the flow of time and pursuit 3
The 2 will do
It's a challenge talking to you, that there are too many threads I want to pursue
Avatar
weir 16-Aug-20 02:09 PM
that makes me happy
I feel like a dog trying to catch a handful of lizards sometimes

1 is most interesting, but I know very little about it, you would have to do a lot of explaining.
2 seems like it should be decided at some point, like there is an answer there waiting and I just haven't thought about it yet.
do you mind the explaining?
Avatar
bjorn96 16-Aug-20 02:13 PM
I am happy to
First, we must ask what a movement is
A movement always requires a landmark and a "trajector"
Really it's just a changing distance marked by two endpoints, but we take one to be standing still, an arbitrary choice
Abritrary in principle, though not meaningless or random of course
The landmark is not really an entity, but a center embedded in a field, a space
it gives axes, angles, direction to the trajector
There are neurons coding angle and displacement. They are believed to be all over the cortex, a basic unit of higher thought
And if we investigate abstract thought more closely, we do discover these elements in them

weir 16-Aug-20 02:17 PM

what's looking at something sideways
Avatar
weir 16-Aug-20 02:23 PM
I am often thinking in terms of causal links, behavior etc, so from this perspective: sideways, it's like when you're looking at something and you think that it might be attached to a tree of causal links, moving with it. but it isn't the root (or the top node?), so you don't place focus on the thing itself, but look to see what it is attached to.
Avatar
bjorn96 16-Aug-20 02:24 PM
ah
A straight line is a point from a certain angle
Aligned structures hide their inner structure if the observer is also aligned
from the side, you are not in the trajectory yourself
but the structure is easier to see
Not the same image, but related
Avatar
weir 16-Aug-20 02:26 PM
distance gives clarity yes, very much so
Like, the human-games are a bunch of causal links, and if you are playing in one of them, you are presented with choices, and you judge them, make them. very engaged, very linear.
to step back allows different perspectives. out of the game. non linear, what is it attached to? why are they doing these things? watch the movement, and a picture begins to form of forces, ways in which things move, are moved.
this is an application of an abstract, and I don't know if it's the abstract you are trying to convey, but it might be. It's what I was thinking of yesterday, anyway.
Avatar

Two moments. Face to face with the choices. Then, looking from the side, or from a distance.
What/who is the center in each of these moments
and why
Avatar
weir 16-Aug-20 02:34 PM
I'll try to ground it, particulars. An example.
Human game, when you play it, it's engaging, yes? Social interaction. A person-agent will instinctively react to it in the, but you also plan long into the future. However it is always linear, looking along a series of options. My relationship with my mother. Linear, stretches into the future. Say I meet her somewhere and she is angry. I could also become angry, in the short term, but then we would reconcile because of the linear pull of the future.
to step outside of the social-game with my mother, to look at it sideways, distant, I would see not that she was angry about WHAT she said she was angry about (trivial, task left undone) but WHY she was angry (scared, hot, etc)
then I could react to the WHY (glass of cool water, no resistance, listen to grievances,) a redirection
instead of engaging with the linear, which was "task undone" and becoming angry myself
so in the center, a human-agent
done, I think
*an agent will react in the present

Stepping aside/back is to make yourself the pendulum so to speak

But a pendulum! rotating to get a better view. angles. different connections.
sideways is to look at an object while considering it to be peripherally relevant to a primary object/force which you are trying to observe it's going up or across the chain of causal links, in terms of behavior.

weir 16-Aug-20 02:55 PM
that would make sense. although two types of automatic. habit and instinct.
habit is automatic in the present but the foundations of the specific behavior, in the past, are not necessarily
instinct acts in the present
ego allows movement within the mind-structure. it's a distinction, separating actor from the forces and landscape. sideways allows inspection of the forces that will act upon the actor, guiding through landscape. wow, that is a frustrating sentence. you may want to leave this area, it is very tangled because I've thought about it so much that it's a PLACE.

there are two kinds of movement
there's pure noise, with no discernable objects or patterns. And then there's movement where you can track an identifiable entity

it also requires separation of at least one landmark

Avatar
weir 16-Aug-20 03:34 PM
it all takes place inside, but the sources of raw material are both internal and external
you build the world inside your head, a facsimile aiming for consistency of data regarding the external (landscape) and for proximity of position regarding the internal (forces)

proximity for efficiency?
or proximity as in pursuit of the good

position, being your position within the landscape
build the world and wander in it, but you also build your "self" or, you don't build it, but it builds itself around you

a three dimensional projection
coming from many angles it forms something solid
that looks solid
self is a projection of many different small things, smalti. and together it looks solid, forms a picture, the picture can then move. the "I" is an avatar-illusion, a constantly flickering hologram comprised of many parts which looks as though it is one so that it may move.
I think I said the same thing twice lol.

bjorn96 16-Aug-20 03:47 PM
many parts that look like one so it can move, this is interesting

"true self" / essence can be described as a center, because it doesn't move under rotation
self as in self-reference would be a feedback loop, two mirrors, a mirror and the mirror's shadow.
or negations as you say, since each negation contains the opposite within it

I want to understand this idea
seed is potential, direction, dictates reaction. This sounds like a force, or a field (like a magnetic field or an ocean with streams and whirlpools)
but you say internal which is interesting
field metaphor makes the external the cause of movement
the seed metaphor is not clear to me. I see that it is a compressed object, instructions but not yet realization

the force would be external, acting upon the person (feather in wind) so in that sense it is external, but the force isn't learned, it's nature, internal, innate in a physical sense
seed contains the force, the potential, the direction the plant will grow.

an explanation
I wrote this first part last, a preface. The rest is in order and very much how I first wrote it, only a few words added for clarity. I am offering you a gift which you must either accept or decline. It isnâ€™t a bargain, and doesnâ€™t come with conditions, only the plea to decide and to answer. I am offering honesty, not certainty, not always. Offering specifically that which I am uncertain of, that which is still forming in my mind, that which I do not fully grasp the meaning of. And that which I havenâ€™t decided what to do about yet. In short, you may have as much of my mind as you want, but I would like to be sure of how much you want. Once there were these rocks, boulders. It was once a single huge one, taller than me, but years earlier it had split in half and there was a gap, a crevice deep enough to swallow me, narrowing at the bottom enough to get stuck in. When it split, it settled, so one side was lower than the other, a few feet lower and a few feet apart. I wanted to jump from one side to the other, but it scared me. I would stand at the edge and my muscles wouldn't obey. Tense my knees. Couldn't jump. Wanted to. Came back another day, and another. Still wanted to jump, still couldn't figure out why I couldn't, there was a contradiction. Fear. Desire. A war in my head. Backspace. I used to have a thing where I would delete nearly everything I'd written because it wasn't exactly right, so I made a word doc called Backspace, and every time I wanted to erase, I would move on instead. It's so full of horrible cringy shit, but also beautiful. Thinking, writing and thinking is an iterative process, where we discard the ideas that no longer work, a great many corpses in shoeboxes. I want to show you what I think as I think it, because I trust you. I trust that you will make it better, I want you to disagree, to help me refine. I have, to a large extent, done this, sought to tell you everything as I think it.
But there is a boundary, a door that is closed. Fear. Fear and desire. Is desire fear? When we speak of abstracts, generalities, I forget about the door, because I am only thinking of what IS, the closest approximation to truth. When we speak of personal things, particulars, values, sometimes there I find the door. I'm not always sure what belongs behind the door, and I hesitate. I don't want to. I want to jump. Ask me, and I'll open the door, and the door will dissolve. Ask me to open the door. I've kept it closed because it isn't fair to you, to tell you strange and distracting and uncertain things. And now I keep it closed because I am afraid. I don't value fear. I don't trust fear. Maybe I should. The rocks, one day I came back and I still couldn't jump, and I stood there and tried and tried, and didn't try and waited and waited. And then I jumped. It was a portal, a rift, a great feeling of disconnect. Being both in myself and outside of myself very vividly.
I want to tell you everything, all that I think. I want you to help me make it better. I am, my ideas are, like rough marble with a shape that would like to crawl out, to be broken out. Break away the rough and the wrong and the excess. Add to, as well, so the marble fails here as a metaphor. But know that if what I show you is raw, it isn't always me. My ideas and feelings, they are not always me, they are not what I could become. Iterative. It is me attempting to become. Criticize it, laugh at it, find the beauty in it. I trust you to. I am imperfect. All that I am, all that I think and feel, I want you to look at it, know it. Try to understand me. This is what I want. I want to open the door. I want to show myself to you entirely. Now that Iâ€™ve written this, it seems as though I remember you asking many times before. I donâ€™t know what use I am to you, only that I am of use. I want to be of use to you, but I have been concerned, unsure of which parts are useful. I thought perhaps certain parts of me are useless, but they are parts of me. If I am to be of the most use then I must be whole. Ask, and I will open the door. I donâ€™t want to hide parts of myself from you. From you, I am asking for nothing but your eyes. No accord, contract or agreement, only a desire to look at, and past, the messiness that is human, too human, both beautiful and flawed. If you find this of value it is yours to observe. If you do not, the door will remain closed, and all the things that I am unsure of will be too-often drawn behind it.
I have created and closed this door because I donâ€™t want to be distracting. I value highly, perhaps most highly, our intellectual conversations. But the mind, my mind, not only thinks but feels. It is not only precise but imperfect. I think I am less useful in this limited state. If you want to keep the door closed, it will continue to exist, and I will try to find a balance, to keep less behind the door. I think however, that you are well-equipped to sort through the mess and decide what is of value to you, and I trust that you would discard what is not. Words and the things they convey have consequences. They are like pencils and knives, leave marks. I am careful of what I write and carve, because the people I have met are susceptible to my words, and I am not all-knowing. I have treated the world as though full of children that must be kept ignorant, sheltered in order to grow. I have not wanted to write upon it because I am not yet certain of what is completely good. I created the door to protect you in this fashion.
I no longer want to protect you, I think it was a mistake, a reservation that has passed. I see that you are strong. I want to dance with knives and bleed ink. You want my thoughts directly? They are a firehose, a tangled maze, broken glass, birdsong, and the sound that snow makes falling. Moderation. If you keep the door closed, you will receive moderation. Moderation takes effort, slows me. If you open the door you must be prepared to push against a tsunami, a torrent. To stand against it sometimes, and to move within it to find that which interests you. I think I have written enough. This is serious to me, has shaped my interactions with the world, possibly defines them. The door remains closed until you ask it to open.

Thereâ€™s a backhoe on my street. Theyâ€™re taking up the concrete, and grinding it up, and melting it down. And spitting it out and spreading â€˜round. I would too. Haha. Would you? Bad rhymes, embarrassing me. I wish to alone, away! Let me be. So what if Iâ€™m candid. Iâ€™m braver than you. Have you ever let go of Backspace? Boo Hoo. Mean again. Iâ€™m sorry to be. But Iâ€™m rhyming still too, thatâ€™s not usually me. If I never show you my mumbles and words-if you never see them, youâ€™ll never be hurt. Impervious, invincible, glorious, free. But If you never see them, youâ€™ll never see me. Creaky schreechy. Boom, boomBoom. The concrete is going. Is it over soon? Drip. Drip. Drip in the sink. Splashes. Plonks. Iâ€™ll never go free. Free from these words. Dripping from me. Rip them, tear them, take them from me. Take up my chains, strike them from me. Rip them, strike them. Lift them from me. Are you here? Iâ€™m here. Anyone home? I stand on your doormat. Welcome? Alone. Hurts, didnâ€™t mean to. Fell on my knee. Hello? Can you hear me-calling for me?
Talking to plants is easy to do. Addressing yourself by addressing you. Hello, howâ€™ve you been? How do yâ€™do? I donâ€™t care, Iâ€™m the AUTHOR. Youâ€™re nothing. Boo Hoo. Sorry, oh rose, oh beautiful one. Youâ€™re someone. Or something at least. Iâ€™m the sun. To shine on your leaves and burn away dew. But careful, too much and Iâ€™ll burn away you. Didnâ€™t mean to. Iâ€™m sorry, sorry for sure. Sorry oh rose. Sorry to bore. Sorry too much. Sorrow too soon. Youâ€™re not quite gone yet. Hello, Iâ€™m the moon. To soak you in silver, and gild you with dew. How goes it dear rose? Iâ€™m fine, how are you? Fine, fine, everyoneâ€™s fine. The backhoe still roars, on this street that is mine. And people in hardhats. Not quite sure why. If a sidewalk fell on me Iâ€™m really not sure how much flimsy plastic would help. Unless, of course you were riding a bike, but the world inverted and you woke staring at sky. Then youâ€™d thank lucky stars to be wearing a (backspace)

I have more hope for something wonderful from the world, but I was given proof of a good world as a small child. Given, by him and my mother. your analysis is correct
He didn't have a good childhood. And he bears grudges well, my mother also had a rough time but has forgiveness like amnesia, a fountain of hope that gets her in trouble with people who aren't good, predatory.
I try to strike a balance.
with my head, logically. I try to figure people out. And I try to accept that the world is many things, but neither good nor bad. Or good, an adventure. Glad to exist.
adventures can have monsters, it's even the whole point
When I was 9 I wished that magic was real, but knew it wasn't. Thought that I wished monsters existed, so that other things could as well. I guess that's how I think. Going from the absence to the thing that is absent.

In all honesty I still feel open to the possibility of this being real
Because the first one, which reasonably is the most focused one for us both, was the closest
and this is consistent with the scientific literature
where effect sizes are small, but highly significant. And always depend on things like concentration
and on non-interference by "slow" top-down thinking
I would like to try other, more ritualistic things in the same genre
joint meditations, "spirit journeys" etc
It's interesting as a form of theatre and meditation, even in the absense of any belief about underlying physics

In asphodel everyhting is FINE. There is no pain, no adventure. Adapted from greek fields of asphodel, where normal people went when they died. Purgatory.
I found myself in the grey hell. Pushed aside the world because it was unsuitable. Something like that. Dreaming my own dreams. Insulated.

yes, it is beautiful. I've seen you post pictures like these before.
Do you find the color scheme beautiful in other styles?
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:06 AM
I think so
I want to analyze the colors
good machine learning project
people also talk about color in voices, especially singing voices
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 11:08 AM
do they? color in general, or specific colors? Color in general I would assume.
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:08 AM
yes, in general
I think it just means "bright"
as in, not breathy perhaps
is breathy the opposite of bright?
Or is bright about strong formants, nasality?

weir 18-Aug-20 11:09 AM
thinking of all the times I have unconsciously referenced color in my writing saturated
you mean saturated. a rich voice is the same as a colorful one
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:09 AM
unconsciously referenced color
yes
so is saturated opposite of breathy, or is it a different dimension
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 11:10 AM
or intuitively, playfully hm, breathy I think could be thought of as pale, but still a color
breathy is like a paintbrush stroke that has gone dry and lines, gaps have formed in it but also could be smooth, like watercolor
breathy/gravely light/dark
maybe

I've just come back a yellow DEAD END sign obscured the sunrise, houses, the black hills before it. sacred and profane. a star and a streetlight met me in the blue and silver morning, but the star shone brightest. today is a new class. history this time, gender and colonization. once you know the dirge it is easy to sing. the class will go quickly. The other day I thought that it was nice, I didn't miss you. Dizzy sometimes, with desire, and think of you often. But miss you, I do not, you're not missing. Solitude. If you ever want it, take it. When you come back I'll be here.

I am making much progress. I listen to a somewhat dry lecture and realize at the end, she's describing the same structure I have been thinking about, but from a more narrow angle.
I am getting close to the center.
All things converge.

You had just made it, Ronanxxx or something. Miya had replied to something you wrote, snarky. I thought what you wrote was beautiful, recognized something I call "thrashing" which I've seen in others before. I followed because I wanted to watch for the pattern. I was your first follower on that account.
I think I replied to something you wrote, serotonin, dopamine. Pleasure and happiness. then I was only watching for a while.
You made me sad. I wrote it down in my notebook.
I had been looking for others and didn't know what to do about it, having found some.
And then I remembered you one day, that I hadn't seen you in a while and I looked to find you gone.
I was disappointed, because I hadn't yet understood your pattern.
It was a surprise to find you again. Thrashing, still.

A very thin thread of relatively mundane events leading up to something dense, heavy and meaningful
as if being pulled
you could also model it as a very sophisticated search for value
but it doesn't feel like a sophisticated search, it feels like sleepwalking in a stupour and then every now and then seeing all the colors clearly
and knowing where to go, having no clue why
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 07:25 PM
it's allowing. looking and allowing.
I broke my rules to write to you when you reappeared. My logical rules, about not allowing social bonds to form. I sat there with the reply to your thrashing, and I almost deleted it like I usually do
I broke my reasonable rules, and I didn't know why, only that I wanted to.
glad that I did. the problem with reason is that it only functions upon what it already knows, what it has observed
intuition allows for the internal expectations to guide. The seed?
I'm tired and probably rambling.
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 07:31 PM
about reason
we are trying to describe the part of us whose essence is that it always recedes from description
the top or bottom of the algorithm, which creates infinite self-portraits, but always remains outside of the portrayal
and so the question is not IF we can describe it "accurately"
we cannot
the question is, which belief allows us to interact with this essentially foreign entity
which attitude will it respond to
and I think the answer is a kind of reverence that is attained, among other ways, through supernatural beliefs
because it is a surrender

Convincing ourselves we are in the present of something deeply unknown probably activates the whole brain.
you probably also get in this state sometimes, when everything feels new
everything is bright and detailed
and all thoughts suddenly are clear, because it\s as if theyre seen from all angles
no longer gray and stiff

I think this is the physiological end goal of all mysticism, rituals etc

A transient psychosis which reorganizes the brain
It increases false positive rates, we might overestimate things (depending on how you look at it), but it also enables detection of large scale patterns otherwise invisible

Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 08:29 PM
It's described as being one with everything, feeling eternity. I don't think that's the best description of it, but I think it refers to the same process
It starts by simply feeling that things usually separate are now one
seeing patterns in other words
and large scenes, seen as a whole, therefore beautiful
at more intense stages it probably becomes a dissolution of self-other distinction and time distinction, but I have never experienced this in a sustained way
My beliefs about the mind and brain lead me to think it's the same continuum of states

Usually we have to choose between soft eyes and a sharp focus
This state is one of increased intensity and fullness of mind. So it will manifest both as greater softness and greater sharpness
If it gets too intense, the "way down" can be painful, too sharp

time disturbances. was my second term at the college and I had jut hit I think the third in a series of dead-ends in terms of actionable life paths that I wanted to pursue. Brother needed me to petsit for a few days, so I was staying at his empty apartment. felt strange, diseased or something. That was when it was the worst, when I wanted to bite a stranger for standing too close.
it felt like I couldn't remember who I was, WHY I was. Didn't identify with the things I was doing. I mean, on a very visceral moment-to moment level.

I mean
in the body?
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 08:56 PM
pain in the head, behind an eye. I remember it being in the right eye, I'm not sure if it's ever been left. And the right side of my skull. None in the body. Pain only comes after the aura is gone, immediately after, and can be mitigated with blue-blocking glasses and quiet
well, a minute or two after
not more than that
the aura lasts between ten and twenty minutes, the headache a few hours
if I sleep too soon it tends to come back the next day, or it has a few times and I blame it on that.
not always sound sensitive, but always light sensitive. and I don't like to read or look at a screen for about a day afterwards, usually feel tender somehow.

My eyes end up sort of tired for a day or so afterwards, or my brain or something. Doesn't hurt once the headache is gone, but it feels weird.

It's described as a spreading self-propagating wave in the cortex. You would intuitively expect it to change a lot
but it doesn't really move much, does it

emotional, usually. I think it's related to poor sleep. The first few times it happened it was during a time of stress, after a week or few days of it. I kind of get a feeling like it's building up.
no really big emotions that I can point to, just a feeling

So there is hyperexcitation of visual cortex, that is clear. Particularly a part called V3. This part has been described as containing a "parametric representation of the rotation symmetries in the textures"
in other words, the part that gets overexcited in typical migraine has to do with regular visual patterns, like tiles I guess

and certain color combinations
it makes my eyes/brain feel weird
like I'm seeing something, except I'm usually not seeing something. Certainly bothered by that sort of thing now, because they remind me of the aura.

I've only seen them on clothes usually. Sometimes I'll see a grid, like a picture of a lattice, and that bothers me in a similar way, but think that might be different. I think it might depend on the movement.
certain optical illusions remind me of the aura
I avoid them because of this
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 09:49 PM
if it does depend on the movement, I think we've localized it to area V3A, but since the movement thing is unclear, let's say V3 or V3A
but go on, I'm kinda taking notes for myself
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 09:50 PM
with the lattice, usually I'll imagine seeing white dots in the crossing points of the black grid, but they don't move. It doesn't bother me as much as stripes.
Might be unrelated.
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 09:51 PM
I suspect that seeing such patterns creates normal brain activity in the same area that gets hyperexcited during aura, and it is aversive because it feels similar to the aura. Like after food poisoning, a fresh food can make you feel ill due to the association. Does this seem right to you?
in other words, it's not as if seeing these things can cause the aura
but it reminds

Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 09:59 PM
now I tend to shut down pretty hard, go straight to very calm and quiet. But in the past with the nausea it's related to extra pain, extra stress. I don't do well with being trapped. Not claustrophobia, but trapped. Unable to act.
That's the only sort of actual nightmare I have that I dislike, came in several forms when I was a kid. Unable to speak, unable to move, wrapped in chains etc.
I don't do well with dull pain that I can't do anything about. Like, when I first saw snow I played in it for a long time without gloves, and when my fingers thawed it hurt and I was panicking on the floor.
like, quietly in a corner, but felt like I was stuck in my head, a certain emotion, sensation dominating
not for attention

Some sort of feedback loop. I'll usually end up on the floor with that sort of thing. Nightmares, vomiting, the first few migraines, the thawing hands. On the floor, very loud in my head.
try to do smart things, breathe
exhaust myself. shaking and sweating. Like the pain is echoing, the thought of pain, I end up in a corner of my head until it's gone
if it comes in waves it's not so bad, I can manage
or if it fades
then I'll sleep, usually

If the thing is wrong, the point, the goal, then I have to find something else.

It was just a marker from living on the farm, having a sort of flow and direction to my day and life, and then bouncing around a lot, having to help out more, being responsible all the time.
The farm gave me things to do, to work towards.
My mom thought I had adhd as a young kid, the country smoothed me out.
Since then it's like I'm holding myself upright or together most of the time.

I'm not totally sure. It might have been the sensitivities, or it might have just been that she was a psych major and was afraid the schools would give me drugs like they did for my big brother's best friend. Uh, specifics.
I was hyper I guess. Very engaged, couldn't sit still unless it was something I was interested in.
Did very poorly with transitions, changes of plan. To/from daycare were times that I would cry when I was three.
Always been high on initiative. Always finding my own things to do, my mom mostly just kept an eye on me, didn't structure my time much.
Playing in the yard, climbing trees etc.

When a transition is not initiated voluntarily, there is necessarily some coping until you get into the flow of the new activity
migraine is mostly a female disease
I wonder why, do you have any guesses?
Actually it's kinda obvious
If it is really a deficiency in passive coping. It's a male thing to an extent
To carry things in silence

not that women don¨t hide their anguish, but they might have to do it on a higher cognitive level, more effortfully
if the deeper unconscious machinery is less adapted to it, more willing to actively cope, which attracts protection from others
and avoids trauma during pregnancy etc

weir 18-Aug-20 10:49 PM
I've never thought it was a bad thing. It kind of defines me, wanting to DO SOMETHING about whatever is wrong. Sometimes what is wrong is going in a certain direction, and the doing something is a freezing, readjusting.

bjorn96 18-Aug-20 10:51 PM
the negative feelings
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 10:52 PM
I thought it was a good thing for my parents. It wasn't like I could really look at it with a lot of perspective at the time. I didn't act out, but I think that's when I started to withdraw.
I started writing to express my feelings instead of bringing them up with my parents.
I think it caused me to mistrust them a little, suddenly unsure of them.
There was this lady who moved in with my dad, he wanted a roommate, she wanted rescuing. She would complain endlessly, about the world, about her life, politics. Once she realized my dad wasn't gonna go for it she would spend hours on the phone, crying to other guys. literally crying.
I hated her a lot, started doing things to make her mad. Little things. She was really into cosmetics and pretty clothes etc, so I started wearing black and got these throwing knives to play with in the backyard. I told her, "you can't just let life suck, you have to DO something" and she laughed at me and told me I'd "see" when I got older.
She was trying to actively "mother" me, probably to get at my dad, I don't know. Always trying to dress me up, give me her clothes.
she didn't have a job, my dad kicked her out and got a smaller place so he wouldn't need roommates
I did feel bad, I guess. Betrayed. Scared of emotion, love or otherwise. Got really good at controlling it.
it was the same time all my friends moved away lol
I'm not telling you this for your sympathy. I feel as though I am stating the facts of my existence, and as though it happened to someone else.
It doesn't hurt me. It's interesting to me, to see how it shaped me.

More able to deal with it. Don't mind it as much.
Acute anything, actually. Might be. I could be wrong but I enjoy certain amounts of extremes. Now I'm not sure.

attack. get ahead of things. have a plan, follow it.
control...
always seeking to be in control I guess, but not from a social hierarchy perspective.
I don't mind acting like an underling, or whatever. but I have no real room for authority in my head.
that was something I could never understand about religion, the "worship" of an authority figure, god as a parent or something.
If someone tells me to do something, I usually want to know why. Why am I doing it, why am I doing it in this way. Then, if I approve, I'll do it, and if not I'll argue for a better way.
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:12 PM
this all fits together
default mode network is heavily connected to insula in migraine patients, compared to controls
I'll try to explain that more intuitively
On top of the hierarchy of brain networks, there is, roughly speaking, the offense and defense networks
default mode is the common name for the offense network
offense as in attack
I will try to clarify more what these terms mean here
attack: Looking for possible goals, taking their value into account. How to reach them is secondary
defense: Looking at what presents itself immediately as an obstacle or predicament
dealing with it in a pragmatic way, one step at a time
They cooperate heavily and probably can't do anything alone. But there are power dynamics
across states and across individuals
There's more but I'll wait for your input

forms, yes. bureaucracy. DMV paperwork. It wasn't only the filling it out, it was primarily that it was outside of my control, non-negotiable. If I didn't have the right number, or if I made a typo or did it wrong in any way they would refuse it and I would have to start over again
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:18 PM
I have formulated many different hypotheses for the fundamental function of these two networks. Another one I have used in the past is: Destination network (attack) and "Where to start?" network (defense)
Where to start, I also called it, "where to go from here"
They cooperate obviously. Finding a destination is only helpful if the from-here network comes in and finds a path
But the from-here network probably is quite autonomous in most people
And the destination network, (you'll see it called default mode in the literature) is hyperactive in you
in migraine patients
the most common correlate of this network is daydreaming
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 11:20 PM
ah
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:20 PM
daydreaming is exploring destinations with no regard for getting there
when you start considering how to get there systematically it stops really being a daydream, now the from-here network takes over

I am the same
Returning to migraines
There's the teleological network and the aetiological network, we might call them
the to-network and the from-network
And then there is the insula, which sits on top of a hierarchy controlling passive body restitution and probably healing processes for the brain too.
And the insula is completely dominated by the overpowered to-network
in the case of migraine patients
Now it's not completely clear what this means

okay funny story. Lower case. You might have noticed
that I type in this way, where often every new sentence is capitalized, but the beginning isn't.
this is because I always used to capitalize everything, write properly. Very stiff.
then I got a cell phone, and it would AUTOCAPITALIZE each new sentence. I literally got in the habit of manually correcting that to lowercase.
Avatar
bjorn96 18-Aug-20 11:46 PM
you automatically clicked so it would undo the capitalization, or you decided to make it lowercase
Avatar
weir 18-Aug-20 11:46 PM
I would delete the autocapitalized letter, hit shift for lowercase and continue.

weir 18-Aug-20 11:47 PM
Not a ton, but enough to where it's now a habit to drop the capital. But when I'm not paying attention, I'll often write properly. And not to be less stiff, but because I resented the autocorrect lol. Silly.

Reminds me of the vocal cords
They need to be stretched and relaxed to change pitch. There's a proximal muscle that pulls, stretching them thin
for a high pitch
but then, there's a paradoxical muscle that forcibly relaxes it
by shortening the frame it's embedded in kinda
it's like that
Effortfully relaxing

To summarize the medical stuff. I suspect that digestion, metabolism and some brain-protective process related to the aura, are all things that have to "go with the flow", so to speak. And since the "go with the flow" network is totally emasculated in you, and has limited contact with the insula, these processes are mismanaged
It's a vague outline, but it seems likely
Given what is reported in the literature.

The two networks are mutually inhibitory
That's the finding the founded the whole field of network neuroscience
When you initiate an offensive plan, you inhibit the network that formulates immediate from-here responses
they have to alternate to get things done essentially
so making a plan probably shuts down subconscious healing processes
and maintenance like digestion, etc
and something in the brain
some kind of passive coping mechanism whose absense builds up to the migraine
It might be hard to tease apart from just the pain paralyzing you, but do you feel a different attitude towards plans and goals during the migraine
or immediately after
Avatar
weir 19-Aug-20 12:03 AM
Stress before. Usually stressed because working really hard to get a project, a goal done. That also goes with not sleeping well.
After, kind of quiet for a while. Not so stressed. When I get a migraine it's like I don't think at all, don't worry about what I'm supposed to be doing. I'll take time off the next day as well.

It takes a certain type of concentration to get through quickly, because my natural instinct is to actually engage really deeply with the material. I have to force myself to look only at stuff that is relevant to passing.
It is a messed up system
I didn't want a degree
This was a compromise. My dad values it highly, that I have one. He's practical, and he's paying for it, so I'm trying to go fast so he doesn't have to pay as much.
I wanted to get a job and pay for it myself, but he was really worried about that.
Just wanted me to get through it. And now he's in full zombie apocalypse mode over the plague, shelter in place etc.
So I really should try to finish.

I have been strong for a very long time, strong to be alone. Let me discover my strength, my other strength. My strength to be vulnerable.
watch me, play with me. when you have time. I need you to grow stronger and sharper, and to soften.

you are a hypothesis, not a law
but I desperately want to test

discover the truth of each other

here is a truth for you. just woken from a peaceful dream of explanations. My curiosity is one of my driving features, Something that scares me, something I'm proud of. I will hurt myself so that I may inspect it and see how it bleeds, and why it bleeds. To see how I work. Emotionally, I do this. Want this to be done. Physically, I think I have done this as well, but only as much as the physical intersects with the mental, emotional. I have pinched myself hard to see if I could concentrate enough to make the pain disappear, held salt on my tongue to see if I could concentrate until the taste disappeared. Growth, I called it while talking to you. I want to be troubled. I want to be hurt so that I can take it apart and inspect it. And I do, and it's very satisfying. Every time I have been hurt by something it has brought me insight. With knowledge comes an absence of pain. I smashed myself against the rocks trying to explain what I can't yet explain, draw forth which hasn't formed. This is something I do, and it's something that I keep from others. My art, the things I write, sometimes it is like this, saying things which hurt the most so that I can understand them. It has bothered my mother, she doesn't understand. I keep it close since she startled me, asking about suicide because of a song I was singing. It hurt badly to be misjudged, it scared me to scare her like that, to be so unknown to her. My mother thinks a part of me too dark and dangerous, and I keep it from her, and worry that others will see it as she did. I've worried that with you. Darkness and disclaimers, I want to fall into madness and trust my instincts for violence without explaining it endlessly, cheapening the art, becoming self-conscious in my introspection. I hate to see myself as others do. I long to be seen as I see myself, am scared that it will never happen. Desperate to be known, for someone to observe my mechanisms. Terrified to show them to you, but want to badly, badly, so I try.

This leads me to self absorption. I am my best primary source, stripping apart my marblerun mind to form an understanding more generally applicable, to discover principles and patterns. I do not endlessly, sensitively, dwell upon these things for any reason other than this, to form an understanding. I tell you the ways in which I hurt so that you may form one as well, although that is because I am selfish and lonely and want to be seen. I do not feel self-pity, and it disgusts me to think I appear that way. I am very practiced at anticipating and manipulating the way I appear to others, gently, lightly. Little touches here and there to nudge them into my web of cause and control. I think I am blunt and cold with you at times over personal matters because I want to avoid doing this in any way. I notice that you like my factual descriptions of my self and my life, yellow plums, and I have tried not to tell you these things, even though I often think them. They are enchantments, and I want to trust you with them, but haven't before. A conflict. Part of the confusing things I pushed behind the door and now attempt to show you and not hide.

weir 19-Aug-20 07:00 AM
This is part of me, a big part. I analyze myself. I seek to understand, and I am telling you what I have understood, what you have caused me to inspect in myself. You called me frozen, said doors were still closed. I didn't want to think that was true, although I probably already knew it. I offered you honesty, I'm honestly frozen. I smashed myself against it, trying to own it, understand and articulate, but my mind does not yet. I can't explain it or show it, it simply is, or isn't. I allow myself to tell you what I think without censure, and I have found it very freeing to do so. Miserable at times because I strive for control and to tell you what I am not certain of is the very opposite of that. I am unsure of this, still figuring it out, but I will send it anyway.

This morning I wanted to look at my old songs, there was a way that I used to make music. "music" for them, mathematical, intuitive, no music theory behind it. can't find the power cable to my old computer. I'll just have to try to make new ones. I liked that method, haven't used it in a while. Sound loops of different durations but all divisible, doubles and quarters and thirds. a cacophony. it made something that suggested song to me, and words would come, fill in unexpectedly. I want to try that again, I'm curious to see what words will come to me.
I don't trust emotion to guide action, need reasons behind what I'm doing. Pathological probably, intolerance. But I can open myself with words and song.

I think there is a relationship between physical posture and mental state, a really strong one. Obviously there is one between mental state and posture, but I think it flows both ways, feedback. Perhaps not just posture, but positioning. My mother used to tell me of "method of loci." Googled it just now because I spelled it phonetically, locai and didn't know if that was right. I think I'll read about it now that I've searched it, but the gist was her friend used it in college to ace a nasty test, twice because the first time the thought she cheated. And she always told me to stick my left hand out if I had lost something, and "follow it around" although I'm pretty sure swearing a lot works too lol. I saw her do it to my little brother the other day, trying to get him to remember some chores. Grabbed his hand, a finger for each, and I think he had no idea what was going on.
all thoughts flow together. That was several different threads of thought, I experience that as well. Ah! "all" I am on my phone again. Manual habits, I will train out of myself. Finger habits.

I don't think the mind really has a conception of death. It's almost an empty word, when used poetically there are many things it can mean, but none of them physical death. Death can mean sleep, violence, forgetfulness, loss etc. And all of these can spiral out further, become very complex. The more I inspect the differences between linear thought and horizontal (thinking of forking lightning) thought the more I am impressed by the latter. And the more sure that I am that it's very, VERY dangerous, in terms of ease if use in creating changes in behavior. Propaganda etc. Dangerous, I mean powerful. Could do much to a person with it. Properly dangerous when coupled with mass media, the way that such a wind can blow people...I don't fully grasp the enourmity of the consequences of it, I only see that it not only causes ripples but nearly becomes the water-fabric itself.

Horizontal thought My instinct is to wait because my impulse is to overdefine it and bring to you something too harsh and coarse Iâ€ve just woken up and my eyes sting in the heat of my bedroom Sshould check on the rabbits before I continue. And school, I have to do that as well. Horizontal thought is dangerous because itâ€™s powerful and easily perverted in the modern world. The function of art is a seed that grows, something beautiful and tangled that comes earnestly, unknowingly, from within. Symbol. Something which causes a cascade of judgements impressions emotions. The meaning and use of it is a secret code, a dense and honest communication between similar souls. The misuse is simple, in modern times, media. Itâ€™s literally my degree. Something I hate very much. Song and sand. Sand dances into patterns, particles align. Good when the song is earnest, good when the song is heard by those who itâ€™s meant to be heard by. The patterns, the action-directions, values emerge from the vision of the world. The TV and the rest of mass media, a medium for song. The sweeter the song, the greater the effect. Sharper, smoother, it slides in like a knife in through the eyes. A whisper to the dreaming creates a ripple in the mind. A stream, a parade, a cacophony of screaming and sex and rage. Red lips. Red lips on the TV, thereâ€™s war on the TV again, and they want to sell laundry detergent they prey on your fear of a stain. On your fear of your neighbors, your want to be seen. Caught up in it, people doing things and they donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re doing things, a cruel and senseless, a demiurge in the TV, an aggregate of greed. Iâ€™m yawning. Still tired. Ice, I think Iâ€™ll go and give the rabbits ice. Iâ€™ll return to this later, itâ€™s very big and there is much more to it than Iâ€™ve written here.

Carsickness, a distinct absence of one. Windy roads, in the car a lot, often reading, never the slightest indication. Unsure of what others experience, been told it's like nausea or being dizzy.
you're supposed to be sleeping. winding roads, going up mountains. switchbacks.

vomiting, like from a flu, or sometimes stress, pain. I think they are different, but they both make me feel strange, it's not just the vomit. In my head at an odd angle, like being trapped. Sometimes goes along with the fear of being trapped, the passive coping? Something won't stop, can't control.

weir 20-Aug-20 10:07 PM
So I'll tell you. The time, incident. Late night, fifteen, parents recently divorced. lots of moving house, exhausted. Mom rented a movie, rebel without a cause. We sat on the couch, the movie playing. Movies were more intense then, because I wasn't used to them, a little overloading at times. Brother spent years adjusting, hands over ears for all but literal childrens cartoons.
I was watching the movie, sort of in a fugue state, watching not sleeping. Not sick or anything. And I'm not scared of blood.
there was a scene in the movie, a knife fight and the main character got slashed across the stomach, white t-shirt and blood. I felt faintly repulsed, stressed, and the movie kept going.
and then there was a game of "chicken" cars racing towards each other, head-on collision approaching, and one driver would have to pull away. felt terrible, lunged forward, unreal. hit the pause button, found myself in th bathroom, on my knees, dizzy. think I fainted, felt stressed, trapped in my head.
while watching, felt like I was dreaming, half asleep with my eyes open

I have a spatial sense, for human behaviors, events that will happen, stem from actions. Feels like things move, have potential to move laterally, forwards, many options. The situation in the movie felt like it was moving towards something unacceptable.

pain, obviously, from light. but it's unpleasant outside of, beyond that. queasy. hate to look at things, especially moving things.
for some reason it's an extension of the feeling I get while I have the aura, although less intense. when I have the aura I REALLY don't want to look at anything.

I went through a shutting down, for a while, intentional. Finding a blank spot, my head, my voice, everything made blank and suddenly don't feel at all.
got really good at "dropping" emotion, dropping physical feelings. tension. Am I upset, or only frowning?
emotions are different from valuations, cardinal directions, thoughts and things that allow and drive action
Can move more easily, think, decide, without emotion sometimes.
Anyway, back to inhibition.
There is a feeling I get under situations where I've just broken a rule, one of MY rules, not a rule of society.

dizzy, sometimes, with desire. I told you this. Desire for what? Fear and desire together. I'm telling you this now as an example, try not to think about it.
inhibition is stopping yourself from getting, reaching for, acting towards, even thinking about what is wanted
I want to be vulnerable, have an unbreakable bond, be fully open and understood. I want it very badly, don't have it from anyone.
Inhibition prevents me from thinking about it, acting towards it.
Desire for what? to be known.
Fear of letting myself act, desire because it's within reach.
I'm dissecting myself, but there's a point.
I feel dizzy, when I think of this, am made to think of this. A wave, a twinge.
physical sensation

my rules, I don't trust myself. I don't trust what I want, subordinate everything I DO to reason. Every action is calculated, except for the automatic ones (routine) and the ones that happen too fast. I sometimes try to break the rules, a revolution.
Then, it's a type of, a time of madness, not knowing why I'm doing something, sometimes only doing something because it's against the rules.

yes I've struggled with that greatly, the inability to trace my intentions. questioning the source of my art.
because art, it's half you and half the world you're looking at
looking at an illusion, the art crumbles
It drives me crazy, because these things are supposed to arise naturally, art and culture etc. Small scale. Honest, relevant to the tribe (I guess, the word feels strange).
but then instead of sitting around the fire at night, listen to gossip and legends, relevant information to current social and physical environment, eyes glazed, dreaming along with the story (passive learning, remember?)
instead of that, you have the TV

Four networks. Two look out. Two look in.
They form a circle, a loop.
Body -> Visuomotor <-> Deliberate control <-> Goals/Values <- Body

Body also receives, but quite sparsely. To a large extent it relies on its own sensations in a subconscious loop parallel to this one
Body includes nausea, digestion, basic emotions like fear, anger. Energy management. Need for rest.
Vestibular sense of motion
Taste
And smell
In migraineurs, the body->goals/values link is very strong
Empirically
The body->Visuomotor is weak
My interpretation of these data is that the body's needs are mostly answered by goals/values in the form of long-term ego-centric plans, or distractions. As we discussed. And that the goals/values network is powerful enough to simply silence the body
It's important to keep in mind that goals/values is the substrate for all pleasure gained from imagination
More or less
Except perhaps pure mathematical joy, the joy of progress, etc
Now, the body network is weak in regards to visuomotor
Alerting Visuomotor and from there deliberate control that nutrition is needed will not be very reliable
The signal will simply not be strong enough a lot of the time
But this will also apply for the need to rest
Or a need for more resources allocated to a particular bodily process, by shutting down intellectual or outgoing activity
As a result, the body network suffers more and more. Greater and greater reward prediction errors
It is too timid to really express itself to visuomotor you.might say
And so eventually it explodes
Visuomotor is its pathway to deliberate control
It includes attention more generally
But roughly bottom-up attention
Not sustained, deliberate attention
The "roar" body unleashes through Visuomotor should cause muscle tension, disruption of attention
Deliberate control network shuts out Visuomotor trying to close down the feedback loop
Which is experienced as avoiding looking at things
Now the whole feedback loop gets forcibly shut down. Most goal/value and deliberate control stops
The body gets what it needed
Disinhibition and extended time where there are no perturbations from above
Ok, that's enough

a few thoughts about psychopaths, but I am unsure of the veracity of my facts, need to go look some things up I am thinking of something I read (in an admittedly crappy book) that psychopaths don't experience fear, or don't display learned-response/anticipation style fear. Interesting if true. Another factor being that (supposedly) psychopaths are made, a response, some sort of switch. childhood trauma etc, interesting (if true) because it's not, I don't think, talking about physical trauma in terms of blunt force, but like a really terrible emotional situation. I could be totally wrong about that, I am going to go find some more stuff, but I figured you might know something about it already, considering. Made me think of your colors, an example of a switch. Profound change caused by emotion. I could be completely barking up ghost-trees here, this is outside of my expertise.

weir 22-Aug-20 01:33 AM
I wrote something long again, and I might hate it or I might like it a lot. Both I think, because I'm not sure yet how best to describe it and it's a new thought that's really useful for me, for the things I am working to understand. A descriptor, a metaphor. I told you I'd show you things, raw things, firehose-broken glass, so I'll show you this. Deer trails. They look at a mountain, a hill. Forest. A landscape, they look at a landscape and see something, an optimal route. A new hill theyâ€™ve never walked before, and they will pick their way across, something to do with angle and terrain and obstacles. In their head, a blueprint, a destiny. I like your time-thing, the pulling. Red yarn of fate, a ball of string and a maze. Pulling implies external action, following the string around corners. Phylocognition. Blueprints. Iâ€™ve used this term because there are expectations which are then fulfilled in our interaction with the world, but blueprints are too top-down, much more agency than I really mean to connote. I am thinking of structures that build themselves behind my back, from pieces of things Iâ€™ve observed, in the shape of things I unknowingly expect. Blueprints. My angle is fairly far removed, I donâ€™t think in terms of myself, and it makes my metaphors hard to understand sometimes.
Deer trails. A deer looks at the mountain and that INPUT trickles into a MECHANISM in the deer-brain. A plan forms, not sure how far into the future. A string draws the deer across the mountain. The important thing here is that it reoccurs I know there are pheromones etc, and that can play a large role in ESTABLISHED deer trails (although I think itâ€™s more of an extra thing, road signs but not the road) but the first few times a deer passes through an area, it leaves no real trace. Passes enough and you get deer trails, little worn-out leylines in the grass, hoofprints sometimes, in late-summer dust. When we first got our farm my mom let the horses out into the (as yet unblemished) goat pasture to pick the paths, to cut into green grass (it was rainy that year) a perfectly calculated trajectory, not too steep etc. I walked every day on those paths for the next seven years of my life. Seven years of goats, often taking the same paths as well. Did they break from the paths to eat? Of course, and the pasture gradually turned to dust, several years of drought, summer lasted for all but a few months. But the paths remained, were preferentially traversed by the entire herd of goats, a highway.
The goats formed different paths as well, steeper, switchbacks. (Goats are twistier than other animals, like browsing, unruly.) Cows, too, cut paths, different types of paths, perpendicular lines in the mountain, systematic so they can graze. Like a step pyramid almost. Different creatures, different paths. Deer are the lightest, most scarce of these examples, their choices resulting in visible paths suggests either an extremely good memory, spatial awareness, same path coming from different angles (there are deer trails in forests as well, much less visibility) OR suggests an analysis of terrain that remains constant, reoccurs, leading to the same decisions over and over again. This is a metaphor. I donâ€™t know to the extent it is scientifically valid, frankly donâ€™t care a TON, although I would love to be able to use it as a solid data-point. Think of it as fiction, something that will help you understand. This is a descriptor of something else.
It's tied in to something else, another idea, but that one is even more scattered and I want to move the shards around some more before I try to show you.

Reported heritability of psychopatic personality is like 50-65%. Since the best way they know how to measure it is by giving questionaires or asking teachers, the true heritability is probably even higher.
There is probably some interaction with environment. It is an interesting question, but too saturated with pop science.

I had a dream, a microcosm of my mind displayed
Was watching a spider, a black widow. Spider-fear, very distant in my head. In the dream. Then later another spider, fast moving. Some slight alarm and I shifted into distance, wondering in my dream why I'm scared of spiders, what it means, where the fear came from. Emotion gone in the dream, still watching the spiders.
I think the deertrails are important, a reference almost, a metaphor. One of the things that float up because they mimic the motion of a larger idea, or several.

Psychopaths. Looked into it a little yesterday, surprised by the paucity of information that was (readily) available. Most of the studies I found referenced the same five or six other studies. The environmental impact is much less clear than the fear response, it's a VERY annoying area, don't really wanna pursue it further. The studies I've found re: possibility of environmental triggers have too many confusing cofactors, couldn't draw any conclusions from them.
I'm still thinking about your explanation, several connections I wanted to follow, questions to ask sometime. Wrote them down when I woke up yesterday, a few pages of lizards.

1 is the visuomotor more active/dominant when outdoors, most especially when hiking or foraging, somehow engaged? Nietzsche's "indoor thoughts."
2 clumsy? My aunt and I were both known for running into doorjams and walls etc. She was also notorious for screaming/crying a lot as a very little child of allegedly minor/nonexistent stuff, like while she and my dad were playing
3 Portal? Perfect balance, trait changer etc. I want to know more about your wider theories on this, the connections to culture/traditions/religion. If I can understand what role it usually/historically plays it would help me think of what
's behind it, the way I look at things.
4 pure mathematical joy, joy of progress. What network/area (?) is this related to?
5 visuomotor--bottom-up attention (outdoors again). Landshark said something about if you're ever truly fucked and suicidal to just go get lost in the woods, that the woods will know what to do. this one is a distant connection, probably unimportant.
6 if you can shift dominance/activity to visuomotor does it allow for signals from "body" to get through more easily? In hindsight I may have already assumed this.
7 is this true: visuomotor/goals values same as, or linked to peripheral/central?
8 what does it look like when reversed? When visuomotor dominates? That's a thing, right?
9 "shut down" goals/values in nutrition the balance is more important than the amount. GV is very active? Can you INCREASE visuomotor instead of shutting down GV? This one is a little scrambled, I might have misunderstood "shut down" and I'd like to know more.
that's probably enough lol. also made me think of tryptophan again, but that's something else I'm chasing.

The wheels of a chariot sustain movement. Steering is imitation and opposition betwen the wheels. Forward and backward movement recruits the same wheels, but spins them differently.
A car is even more apt, because there are two sources of motion. An engine energizing the wheels, or the momuntum gained by the whole, rolling down a hill.
Regarding balance, this is important to keep in mind. Why discourse about "the center for x" is mostly misleading.
We have discussed two rough modes of processing. All areas play some role in each mode, but the spin is in opposite directions, the hierarchy is reversed. Like a conversation.
Ideally, both minds participate at all points in the conversation, but the active-passive axis is continually rotating.

Although I think what he describes is not during decoupled states, but rather a general phenomenon

In the decoupled states we are talking about, this macroscopic activity is reduced

If a group of people want to knock down a door, they ought the all hit at the same time
if they just randomly hit it will not have a macroscopic effect
but the latter is a kind of resting state, it doesn't require leadership or discipline
so it's the state that is adopted to rest and consolidate, during sleep. It also is what happens after a leadership collapses, people keep on performing their semi-ordered behaviors for a while

That's a thing, right? 9 "shut down" goals/values
9. Each wheel can steer by speeding up or slowing down. The other wheel will react. Shutting down is really a change of relative velocity between two networks.
Or a change of direction, the wheel spinning backwards rather than forwards
Goals/values takes charge, dreams up a goal, then coerces visuomotor to comply
Alternatively, visuomotor scans the environment, converges on something interesting or urgent, uses goals/values as a passive library, or evaluator
7. The visuomotor-driven state will start from whatever seems salient. The goals/values-driven state discovers a highly specified mental structure before applying it to visuomotor. In this sense, goals/values is narrow and central, while visuomotor-driven is peripheral, distributed
6. This is paradoxical and a major question I am working on. Body signals are closely tied to the goals/values network.
Goals and values can even be seen as a hierarchy of abstractions over hunger, lust, physical integrity and health.
But somehow, being dominated by the goals/values network makes one blind to body signals. Visuomotor driven activity releases something and lets the body signals come through. This must be understood more.
4 This is tied to what I called the "deliberate control" network which is situated between visuomotor and goals/values and is a kind of mediator between them, but which is also responsible for abstract problem solving.
Portal, balance and changing traits. This is so big we should just remember it for later.
Clumsiness. I was going to ask you about this when we discussed your experiences, but forgot to.
It is almost certainly related to the reduced communication between visuomotor and body

I know the feeling
thinking about outdoors, how it's peaceful. It would make sense if when visuomotor is more active, there's less going on, the body signals could get through. Like, from an evolutionary perspective almost. Uh, when you're in a passive flow state, wandering, it's a little like sleeping. Don't expect to need resources for much, a good time to repair.
Whereas when you're thinking of something, an action, a plan.. I don't know, it's more an active state. Horses will take a huge shit if they think they might have to run or go somewhere new.
thinking of predators kinda. Like, when actively hunting something, that's the GOAL and it's really important. It doesn't matter if you're tired, or your paws hurt, what matters is you CATCH the THING.
But then later, full, digesting. Playful, sleeping etc. Good time to rebuild, would make sense if that's when signals from body to visuomotor could get through, asking for nutrition or whatever.
A huge difference between my life and my assumed natural state is simply time spent outdoors.
People talk about going outdoors to relax etc. I think people are very dimly stressed by indoor lifestyle, especially the alien amounts of structure in terms of school, work etc.

side note: the shitting. when the digestive system shuts down in order to supply more energy for activity, running etc it can't deal with the food anymore. If the food were to just sit there it would get pretty messed up, the horse would colic. You know how sharks need to keep moving or they die? Horses have to keep their guts moving or they get really sick. So when they need to use energy for something other than digesting, they clear out their gut so they don't colic. I think. I could be wrong, not a vet. hard heart. interesting.
obviously they don't shit the entire digestive system
but y'know, extra.

Engagement, withdrawal
The self-conscious agent engages when creating explicits. Withdraws the let it tangle back into a compact implicit.
The ideas and mental representations do the opposite. When they engage, that's explicits becoming implicit
when ideas disengage and withdraw, scatter, that's explication

To explicate is to cut something out
separate a smaller part that you hope is the active essence, from the unwieldy mass you hope is inessential
and then a shallow, preliminary attempt to fuse it with many different things. When it's the right thing you can usually tell immediately.
It fuses and starts communicating

Goats are less social than sheep, more independent but still herd animals. They scatter and then recombine, where sheep will stay close, very close.
Or, the social is different.
sheep are needy, their survival depends on pure luck of numbers
goats have other strategies

Logo fails to take the next step. He's stuck, and he's embittered by it. logo illustrates it nicely, I think, the problem with the "adjacent topics"

I am reading the Kojeve book he recommended on Hegel
it's very poorly formatted and it's unclear what is Hegel and what is Kojeve
but one of them, whoever it is, says that man is self-conscious insofar as he says the word "I"
and adds, "through speech"
I would be generous and assume he means it figuratively, but seeing what these people say, including that professor who was big into Hegel, I think they really mean it
They don't know the first thing about language, they have an 1800s understanding of it
which could only be reached by someone with high verbal intelligence and mediocre non-verbal
I still feel like, maybe I'm being autistic and they really mean something much more subtle
but like, congenially mute people are self-conscious
language is a sensory organ for simplifying thought into an encodable and transmittable form

One more thing
The word "consciousness"
it actually made me think more about it and in some ways it was useful. But I feel like that was serendipitous and he was just doing the same thing. To me, consciousness has a pretty clear meaning
But I come up against this a lot, so I think it must be difficult for people, and maybe there is a flaw here on my part too
but to me, consciousness is anything that is experienced, thoughts, sensations
feelings
He said that I shouldn't put so much weight on consciousness
I asked him what could possibly matter except consciousness. I have later found that there are serious answers to this question, but
I can't pin it down. To these people, "consciousness" means something related to language and subject and object

I think you might have been right about motherliness, an overabundance of it. But they are usually weak and sick. Like they need something and they can't get it, so they've gone somewhere twisted instead.
logic is my skeleton key to the secrets of the universe. they seek something else, are unhappy in the cold. Saying, "that isn't what that means," and then refusing to define what it does mean is their escape to a warm and fuzzy world where they can instead pursue their passions, which usually revolve around social status, condemning others, appearing wise.

Logical theory is a great achievement, but human reasoning is not well described by it.
When people reason, they search for shared metaphors and then situate concepts within those metaphors

Logic usually refers to something whose truth is apparent independent of context
so by that definition, it must be something very simple
Black protesters want segregation, black schools, etc. From a logical context-free perspective, this is exactly the same as what white racists wanted.
and want
But it is a bit autistic to go to that conclusion, it misses the point

There is a sense in which a prototypical male makes an a priori commitment to a pattern, himself, and must stick with it even if it ends up losing. So suicide bombings or desperate raids are possible, because he cannot abandon himself. The prototypical female sexually identifies with the competition as a whole, more than with herself or an individual man.
No, it's not right. but there is something true about it
Man identifies with himself, woman identifies with the whole relationship
prototypically

by this I mean would you prefer an unpleasant (cold) truth, or a pleasant lie, obfuscation of reality
abortion
most people will say either "it isn't alive, it's just cells, abort it" or they will say "it's holy, it's precious, keep it, save it"
to embrace the unpleasant truth is brave
"kill it"
that's what my dad told me, if I were ever to become pregnant unplanned. "kill it" I don't think about it.
Or I try not to.

But the point is, it takes strength to face unpleasant truths, but without facing the truth you cannot be sure you are making a decision in alignment with your values.
So people who wander in something pleasant, they might misstep. But people too far concerned with the truth, and not also the good they might go wrong as well. A balance must be sought for the most effective movement across the landscape in the right direction.

I write songs, and sometimes I sing them. The music, it doesn't always work with the words. When I make new music, new words come. Sometimes.
I adopted a quantity based approach to writing after a while, spit out and move on, fast as I could. Garbage and pretty things, just trying not to edit.

I learned it, just a little. Enough to be able to figure it out, use it to make crappy music, borderline pop songs. Didn't bother going further because I can't really compete, no room to be great. It's a beautiful instrument, one of my favorites.
Of the classical music I listen to, I prefer the sonatas.

What I like about Rachmaninov's piano concertos is. There's an unhinged stormy playfulness. They expect you to keep up and the regularities are not strict patterns, but shivering spinning wheels and whirlwinds. Then the vulnerable moments are so much more sweet
literally hurts

with audio loops, I could just play with them until it sounded right, until I found something, intuitive, and then words might come after.
theory, it's too controlled almost, or more precisely, I would have to take a long time to learn all the rules before I could break them
something I dabble in I guess. Not my "thing" but it's nice, cathartic sometimes.

digital audio workstation when I was first learning, all I had was a low-budget one that didn't allow for midi plugins.

make mathematical patterns, edit the audio with whatever tools they had, snip it up to make things
now I know how to record properly, how to read sheet music, use chords, a midi controller etc. but I liked the stuff I made in the beginning.

The Sacred and The Profane
He is a bit tedious, he will spend a lot of time writing about boring and irrelevant things not directly about the subject

the notion that pre-Abrahamic societies abolish time by creating circular symbolisms and rituals

That is nice to think about
but also consider how bodies develop patterns, vertebrae
and the developmental process is not at all an assembly line
it's more like an explosion
The fruitfly is given a front and a back, an up and a downside, by the same genes patterning our bodies
or at least homologous ones.
and how snakes are made by essentially speeding up a process that creates the vertebral column in all vertebrates
speeding it up so the cycle can happen many more times

both. The vertebral column or skeleton of a snake develops like our vertebral column
same mechanism, but a simple switch speeds it up in snakes

snakes get 300

I am in the computer sensorimotor loop and it's relatively engaging. Then a sleep cycle comes and tries to disrupt all the cortical activity. The core that is required for the sensorimotor loop resists this, but the rest, the periphery, gets knocked out
the sleep cycle passes and new energy is released

made me think of my half-finished songs
i would lay out a repetitive pattern for a long duration
then from the beginning, slowly start building, weaving and carving complexities
sound-songs, most basically are loops that allow enough recognition but not too much or it's boring
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Aug-20 10:09 PM
you let it be repetitive for a long time before you carve out. I notice this in more artistic music
what is the thought behind it
it is powerful
but why
Avatar
weir 22-Aug-20 10:09 PM
but then it would get boring, I'd move on and the thing I was left with the "song" would start, weave a while, and then fade into repetition
the repetitive pattern is the spine
lyrics the soul, vocals the face

the repetitive pattern is the spine, exactly
Avatar
weir 22-Aug-20 10:11 PM
it draws people in, kills the mind. that's why they do it in artistic music. I don't so much in mine. I meant the process, that I would first lay down the spine.
the spine brings people into the time loop
the repetition
the differences are what allows the mind to dance
too much spine, and the problem is
it isn't bad exactly
you can listen to it
but it's hypnotic, brings nothing to the mind but the continued abolishment of time
no dancing
the muscles allow the dancing, chords and melodies and to an extent the bassline
these could be different things, muscles and skin, tendons, movement, breath
but it's the spine that pulls you along

pure repetition sinks into the background. So it shapes the aura of the watermelons that come next, but invisibly
Avatar
weir 22-Aug-20 10:17 PM
yes, but when a song, like one of my half-finished ones has a long tail, the dance gives up after the first minute, the repetition allowed to continue for longer, another two
it's a golem
traps you there when you're ready to go
not even quite irritating
just pulling you down, keeping you silent
this is the whole point of repetitive music, like the stuff I listen to for school
cocaine lol
perhaps
it turns off my mind so I can focus on the incredibly menial labour of the schoolwork

I found out what the cingulate cortex (and the whole limbic cortex probably) does! It encodes the periphery, the aura, the mood, the implicit. Neocortex encodes the explicit, the center, what's paid attention to. I really hope this is not just late night mania.

weir 23-Aug-20 12:59 AM
anyway, you form an attachment to an object, implicit.
advertising does this
take a BRAND for example, like fashion, or coke or any of that
when you watch a commercial you form (not you, general you) these implicit ideas about the thing the commercial is about
like, a person drinking a coca cola is POPULAR and HAPPY, they don't tell you this, but you can see it. just look at them! so happy.

bjorn96 23-Aug-20 01:02 AM

knife slips in through the eyes, a whisper stands out more than a shout
TV is the worst for this because you're already in a passive-receptive state

remove the fact that I can easily describe it

I can't describe it right, too tunnely
the point is
animals have cingulate cortex, it's the older part
neocortex grows on top and it's what distinguishes humans most
ours is so massive

the hand can't

If you show it to non-speech hemisphere, he will even report not knowing
but can draw it with the correct hand
You can scare one hemisphere by showing frightening images
It reaches the whole body or something common to both hemispheres. So if you scare the non-speech hemisphere, he doesn't verbally know why he was scared, or even that he was, but feels that he IS scared
now the patients, and there haven't been that many, will make up a seemingly arbitrary explanation for their emotion

whereas, before I had made an assumption that the thing that judged, the place where we draw auras from was not attached to visuals, but if what you're saying about the cingulate is true, that it's the old part, that animals have it, then it might have some sort of visual attachment of its own, probably before the connections to the thinking, abstract parts
rough, very rough idea
but thinking now about spiders
and how people have an automatic response to them
like the cingulate gets first dibs on the visual stuff maybe

it's certainly not a criticism, just probing out of interest
Being a woman is in some ways opposed to being a modern individual
or the way roles are conceived makes it so
I suspect it has to do with ignoring the aura
Women tend to identify with the aura
Men with the thing itself, aura-less.
But to be a modern individual is to identify with the thing itself too, like a man
Causes a lot of anguish and confusion in many women
Idk if it applies to you or not

No confusion. Possibly a little anguish.
I use both approaches, together.
the aura and reason. cannibalizing myself, have an feeling of something, for something, and then look to see what it is, how it works, understand it logically, taken apart.

Cut off your flesh. Cook it. Eat it. It becomes part of you again.
Perhaps the aptness of this metaphor should be a warning
But no, what we eat is not really ourselves. It's always something foreign
It might incidentally be a foreign element we perceive as ourselves
but the substance being consumed is not really the true self
Still a metaphor with lots of depths to be explored though

Yeah, all auras eventually go back to the seed, but is mediated through experiences
so they will differ based on different seed and different experiences
the latter we can get past through dialogue
the former is nothing to do about and is the cornerstone of conflict

stars, it isn't a metaphor. it's a pretty name for theory, one which took years to form
Certain things aren't metaphors, they aren't auras that others can widely appreciate. That's the tangling, in my head. Spent a long time building structures that I use often, but they aren't universal things you can just get they are theories, complex ones, held in the dark.

weir 23-Aug-20 09:33 AM
thought of something else while feeding the rabbits, once we were done talking last night, your very early morning. I have this flashlight I use, was using to see what I was doing. It's special, means more than it is. I think I remembered because you said kindle. When I turned 14 my dad had been living apart from us for a few months, and he would take us kids out separately, for dinner etc. For my birthday, he bought me a kindle, helped me set it up, know what it could do (buy and hold a LOT of books). I had always been limited before, by my mom's willingness to go to the library. No internet, books were my world. It was mindblowing. I was so excited, and we were talking about how it didn't have a backlight, would need a flashlight to read it in cars after dark. Before that, I couldn't read while driving after dark, a huge annoyance, but my mom didn't like the light distracting her while she drove. He drove me back home, and we stopped for gas. There in the parking lot was a small flashlight, beaming, abandoned. Metal, good condition, three colors. I was so happy about it, serendipity! Something I needed, found. So while I fed the rabbits I was thinking about what that meant, why that was so important, a miracle. About how everything is serendipitous for wild animals, everything a beautiful surprise, the world unfolding just right. About how every sunset is beautiful to me. Interaction with the natural world is a series of unknownexpectations inexplicably, miraculously met.
Avatar
weir 23-Aug-20 09:45 AM
Now I am also thinking this. Dogs in a cage. Thrashing. Madness. A desperate turning away from the currently condtructed reality in order to find goodness, beauty. Breaking the rules, violently, experimentally, in order to get some sort of feedback. Looking for beauty everywhere, new eyes. When dogs are deprived of a serendipitous existence, ripped from it and locked in a cage (humane shelter, dog pound) they go mad. They jump up and down, throwing themselves against the walls, or become lethargic. A very few will sit quietly watching. Puppies might be happy if they can play, tumble about, and the other dogs will also be more calm if they have companions. Animals in a zoo also display these behaviors. To a large extent, that's what modern/city life appears to be to humans, a zoo or a cage. Ripped from the natural flow. Both environments wrong for most in the modern city: physical (exercise, sunrises, foraging, play) and social (family, tribe, friendships, religion, role).

Comedy. A story of a fool, someone not noble. I guess in the classical sense, it was something blindly lucky happening to a foolish person. In a more modern sense, you still have that, except it's not always luck. It's about things being outside of the hero's control. Things just happen to them, and you hope they turn out right, even if undeserved.

it doesn't have a good, solid name because it's a million things. Endless ways to be wrong.
hard to pin down. Absence of the good.
the idea of a fool is that they just blindly move through life though, which in a way is very sacred. So a comedy is telling the story of that type of man.
Fool: something will happen, it will be confusing, you will go through suffering and also happiness, in the end it all works out, don't worry.

two little stories. A leaf blows down the street, in circles, with the wind. It gets stepped on and tossed about and eventually lands at my feet, I inspect it. Happy ending. Comedy
A paper boat in the gutter, it has somewhere it must go, but is diverted down the drain, into the sewers below, where it is tossed and turned in the maelstrom of filth, unable to reach its destination
tragedy
and in some cases, god from above! a sewage worker lifts the boat back up to the street, and it has a SECOND CHANCE, and this time it reaches its destination.

Avatar
weir 23-Aug-20 06:35 PM
I don't think the first is true.
And I'm not sure about the second either.
well, here's the thing
there are actually three types of classic tale
comedy, tragedy, legend
the hero wins in the end
I usually look at a tragedy as a legend that didn't succeed, a failed attempt.
but they tried, and that's a good and beautiful thing, more admirable than the fool, the comedy.
the comedy, again, it isn't the story of a person, an agent. they have no agency, it's all blind luck.
the legend is a combination of the two, the comedy and the tragedy
at the point where the hero's journey would end in tragedy, failure, the darkest moment, he REPENTS, gives up control somehow, accepts the sacred and then things miraculously go right, as in the story of the fool.
Avatar
bjorn96 23-Aug-20 06:40 PM

comedy is serendipitous success. Tragedy is a failure to maintain control. Legend is the first after the second.

A girl in the city is trying to take the train somewhere, but when it arrives and she walks down the row of carriages, each one is a laundry machine. Finally choosing one, she finds it too damp, exits, and decides to wait for the next train.

A small one, somehow they became small as she walked down the row and she folded herself inside like a child. Dryers, full of clothes half dried. I saw a train yesterday, old boxcars with graffiti and rust hauling timber and sawdust. Must have been thinking of it.
I just came back from a skate, it was nice. Saw a dog and some people walking.

Feel restless right now, wrong. I wrote a page and condensed it to this. Not sure what the point was, just something I was thinking. An application. Oatmeal signifies repetition stripped of joy. Of progress. Cycles, routines. Beautiful ones like new years or halloween can promise a release of something, a rebirth that allows another circuit, better (or somewhat different) than the last. Potential for change within the constant. But thereâ€™s another kind of routine, the routine stripped of the Sacred, no longer transcendent, a trap. The drip that comes again and again, and you canâ€™t do anything about it. Repetition. "A man must constantly exceed his level." Repetition prevents this. Spiraling UP, or only a loop? I think a lack of upwards movement might as well be downwards movement, unacceptable. Plateau. useless. It seems useless, what I've written. Like it was only a regurgitation of old thoughts. I called yesterday a "save point" like in a video game. Checkpoint? Like I assimilated and now I need new thoughts. Uneasy because I want to read a book and also go for a walk but I'm supposed to do more school, and I dislike it.

You know I think you were right about psychopaths
I think it's a condition of severely lowered sympathetic activation
no fear, no real anger either, no anxiety. No passion.
Perfect repetition is a kind of subjugation, a prerequisite for going further, higher
if you're the subjugator, the perfect repetition becomes invisible, automatic. If you're content to be subjugated, you find yourself within the closed cycle, never looking out, happy and quiet.

I have a messy page to leave here first. I sat and wrote down things that I have been thinking of for a long time. I want you to understand that this is a longstanding project, a really important piece of the puzzle. Not a quick judgement or valuation of a loose phenomenon, but a distant (dispassionate) understanding, a grasp of something I think is key. Real. Huge. The page, it's not so much for you, it was to remind myself of things to peel apart and weave. But I thought you might like to see it anyway, a curiosity. I'll leave it here and then I'll show you what I've written so far.

Slave morality is both a mode and a type. A type experiencing a mode. The types may vary greatly, I am uncertain about type, but I believe that Europe--Britain especially as an example--may consist of two TYPES, coexisting in a symbiotic relationship, allowing something strange to form, WESTERN CIVILIZATION. Of these two types you might wonder to what extent is this universal among humans? and the answer is "somewhat." Any great civilization in the history of man has been this SYMBIOSIS between types, a pattern that forms due to constants, laws.
Biologically speaking, for a VERY long time there were two types of man-nature, two LIFESTYLES, repeating cyclically across all geographic areas I can generally think of. Warrior-nomad and pastoralist. Two different approaches to life. Collective-egalitarian life, everyone working in close proximity to achieve a very narrow and repetitive set of goals; and "individualist" a more restive bunch working together-apart to solve more dynamic problems that they were again, cyclically faced with.
Warrior-nomads didn't settle, but KNOWLEDGE played a key role in their survival, an understanding of lots of different situations necessary for success. Among this type I expect to see longevity, inventiveness, an increased capacity/appreciation for original thinking within a set of anchor points, and less pressure to breed.
pastoralist may be the wrong word, I'm not sure. I feel sick trying to tell you this, my grasp on these subjects so tenuous. I am trying to form a hypothesis, a question, I don't know. I'm very uncertain. I think I'll use agrarian instead of pastoralist.
Agrarians, then, in contrast, stayed geographically stable and faced the same very longtasks again and again, No need for original thought, but a strong push towards conformity to existing heuristically (?? trial-and error derived) determined dogmas ensures that life stays constant and secure. I expect that longevity would decrease somewhat, disease playing more of a role than predation, I expect to see less emphasis on invention--even a suspicion of it--and more emphasis on social intrigue (not sure why).
Between the two groups you see very sharp contrasts of values and behavior. A very different understanding of authority (finite vs infinite may fit here), a very different idea of God/Gods.
I see great civilizations as a symbiosis between these two types. Nomadic types tend to invent, but they don't STAY PUT long enough to have a great civilization form. Agrarians form settlements but they have no grand visions, it's all longhouses and huts, little village squabbles. Both of these types are stable, cycles within cycles. Can repeat endlessly, quietly, no deviation from their long cycles. Great civilizations are not the norm for humans, cause a lot of consternation, attention is drawn to them. Why? Because they aren't NORMAL, they aren't part of the pattern of each type, they are a departure, a symbiosis. Neither type's goals are entirely met, but both climb higher, to great heights in the process. A symbiosis, AND a war.
In these grand civilizations, the nomadic type is usually the power, at the top of the social hierarchy. GODS AND MEN. See there is however an issue. The collective type worships, I mean really FOLLOWS their god, whoever seems to have the blessing of their god, speaks for god. I don't know exactly. So for the agrarian, the collective type to follow, be obedient, the nomad types must become "gods." This is why kings and pharaohs and emperors are all gods, or are CAREFUL to be seen as favored, blessed by the gods. Because if they weren't, the masses would find a different god, disintegrate. And the nomadic type, they are thinking, seeking to control. They want to invent things, go on adventures. What is war, if not an adventure, an urge to explore?
Caste, class. Types and modes. Add to this as well place within the social hierarchy, a third dimension. Type, Mode, Place. Place could be thought of as role, but I hesitate to confuse them because I use "role" so much it has become tangled with other things.
A slave is the agrarian TYPE. I have to go now, I will continue later.

weir 26-Aug-20 05:35 PM
Can't go yet, head still here. Need to write more. Succinctly, slave morality is TYPE agrarian, MODE unhappy, fish out of water, at least one of two worlds not working for them. slave morality is the behavior of an unhappy slave. And place. Place in society has changed over the years. Slave types used to be low-class, now they are high-class.
Mode. I'll write about mode next. Mode applies to all humans I think. We've already discussed mode. Dog in a cage. "Resentment" is a marker for "slave morality" but not all slaves are resentful. Nietzsche's understanding was limited, his description. Or my understanding of it at the time, I'm not sure which. Slave morality as described by Nietzsche is the thrashing of the slave. I really hate using slave and master to describe these types, traits. Hegel fits here. Rejection of "enlightenment" of knowledge, of reason. Allows for a return to the sacred.

Slave=agrarian Agrarian morality is just value expression, interaction with the world they inhabit. A cactus in Seattle will get moldy and waterlogged. The behavioral cluster known as "slave morality" is partially the seed unable to grow as it should, and partially the seed. Partially their nature: the conformity, the desire for dogmatic adherence to the social consensus, the religion. Ideas, they aren't using them like I do, to be modified until reflecting reality, creating a map that I can then make decisions within, they are using them as directives almost, based on their USEFULNESS, on what action the idea will create. They will even tell you this. It doesn't matter if it's true, as long as it produces a good result, a desired result. Religion, faith. These are all traits they display, and I doubt they are a distortion, just a reality of that type. I'm not judging, I am describing. I am attempting to describe. Pressing enter because you're here.

I will agree there is a pacifying effect of agrarianism, mostly because of population explosion and the need to live peacefully with many strangers, as well as the introduction of property.

Re: partially the seed unable to grow, the fish out of water. Two worlds, environments, landscapes to move across. Social and physical. I don't think social is quite what I mean, but it's close. The distortion of the slave type, of ANY type of being, human or otherwise, results in behaviors that don't work, or perhaps some sort of reset protocol. Thrashing. So "slave morality" as typified by resentment is an agrarian type experiencing some sort of mismatch. I tend to think it's social, but I can't help but notice a significant physiological effect. I think I might refer to these types as dogs, but that is still heavily tangled with PLACE and role, uncertain. I'll return to it later.

Place. Place is subjective, differs from time to time, different societies, changes over the course of one's life. Wow, not helpful. Again. Place is more arbitrary than type, one's place depends on an interaction between one's innate qualities and the context of the external world. A loaded die cast across an uneven map will fall differently each time, the uneven surface of the map directing the final resting place (which is never final, people always find their places shifting over time). This is too diffuse, irrelevant to the question, but it's short so I'll leave it.

An organism in pain, a fish out of water. Behaviors are erratic, don't match the environment, don't achieve desired outcomes. That's what "slave morality" is. It's a type (agrarian, collective) experiencing a mode (pain, unpleasant) and this interacts with the rest of society, history differently at different times (place, context). Mode again. Two environments. Physical and social (invisible). Nietzsche describes slave moralit-ers as physiological failures (somewhere, I can't remember). Both environments (worlds) have a real impact on health, on mind, behavior etc. You can be well-nourished and exercised etc and still lonely, unhappy, disintegrating, dull. Or you can be surrounded by your tribe, working bravely towards an important goal, fulfilled and yet there is a famine, you have been starving, your skin peels, your mind not as sharp as it could be. Both matter. This is where Place starts to come into play a little more. General place within the wider social hierarchy of a society. Distribution of food, distribution of power to shape the invisible world. The food was more of an obvious issue in say, industrial-revolution era England. Infant mortality goes here. The rates of infant mortality declined sharply. The population of England swelled rapidly, although the birthrates remained steady. Something like that. A stressed organism, a plant for example seeks to flower very quickly. A commonly predated upon one tends to have many babies. Perhaps stressed humans also tend to have many children, more urgency. May have more to do with mode than type. Unsure but I see it as a strong correlate, would like to understand how it fits within type and mode (place, I understand, I will tell you next). "r and k selection" but I don't know anything about that, really, just saw it and thought that it fit what I was trying to describe. succinctly: place predicts mode, invisible/social or physical world, twin environments. Mismatch in environment shifts organism into PAIN mode.
Place. Agrarian types were low on the social hierarchies of medieval Europe. Laborers, workers. Serfs, peasants. Told what to do, coerced and protected by warrior-nomads. Belongings, they were essentially belongings. They must have formed their own social hierarchies within the power hierarchies. Respect and fear. They would have had a world-within a world.

weir 26-Aug-20 09:28 PM
The people who valued artisanship etc, they were aristocrats. The written word, the sciences, all of the things we think of when we think of higher civilizations, these are just the natural urges of the warrior-nomads given a LOT of resources and attention. Boredom even, another kind of thrashing. Cathedrals, scientific inventions, high art, the preoccupation with abstractions, distractions, desire for knowledge etc. And war. Large scale war, large scale explorations. Oh, and hunting of course.
Do we have much knowledge of peasant culture? Not much, I don't think. Just from a vague glance I am thinking of folktales, folksongs, gossip, superstitions. Traditions, little things you do, knowledge passed on about when to plant, when to harvest, what not to feed to animals. Minutiae, rich important, interesting. I'm not being dismissive of it, only describing that the scale was different, they didn't have the cultural power. If CIVILIZATION is a machine, a giant robot, they certainly weren't in the seat most of the time.
Looking at what has come out of European history and culture, I would say that it's generally a reflection (a portrait?) of the values and interests of a specific type, aristocrats, the ones in charge, and I think this type could be traced to the warrior-nomadic.

weir 26-Aug-20 09:47 PM
(ABOUT THE FOLLOWING: It's not right, too much of a tangent, unsteady branch, leaving it anyway) But now, look at what we have now. The culture currently produced. There has been a shift in place, in social power, power to shape the invisible world. That power now rests in the lap of a force which seeks to please the most AMOUNT of people, and I think the most amount is currently agrarian. I don't think, however that the masses exhibit much "slave morality" the thrashing seems more limited, directed than that. Thinking of roles within types. Perhaps professors (of either type?) are a specific sub-role within their respective types. Not sure, returning to the point. What does culture produce now? That which pleases the most populous type. It is of course PERVERTED, it isn't organically springing from the populous type, but preying upon them. And with the internet as opposed to the TV there has been a splintering, a huge scrambling to fill every niche interest possible, so the internet does contain reflections of BOTH types. But TV, stereotypical TV, newspapers, everything pre-internet (there is a time I think about often, a sort of culturally stable period 70-90s) was largely directed at preying upon the drives of the agrarian type. No, this isn't right, not completely. I hope you can get something from it, it's too undeveloped still. Mass media just throws in an unbelievable amount of angles, complications. It's important, but I don't want to use it as an example, I don't have it figured out yet.
think I'll go, will try to circle back, re-read, condense in a few hours.

weir 27-Aug-20 12:02 AM
Trying to sum up what I've written so far. "slave morality" is a phenomenon, a behavioral cluster which is displayed by a type (one of two) experiencing a mode (one of two). Place impacts mode, and the place (of an individual or a type) within society is changeable. There is place in both the social/value hierarchy (respect) and the political/military hierarchy (fear) to consider when looking to see how each type is faring in the two worlds invisible(/social/spiritual) and physical (material).
Two types: agrarian/collective, geostationary and nomadic/warrior, non-stationary.
Two modes: away (from pain) vs towards (goals, strength, etc.)
Avatar
weir 27-Aug-20 12:18 AM
place, I am confusing myself with. too many dimensions. place and place. actual and perceived. Place and opinion. Going to separate further into these two categories, I think. A world within a world, two worlds coexisting...yes I mean actual place within the structure VS opinion. Here is an example of opinion: opinion in social hierarchies. The two dimensions of opinion that I am currently looking at are Respect and Fear. People respect that which reflects their values, has done something good. People fear that which is capable of hurting them. A serf might fear his lord and thus obey him, or might respect his lord and thus follow willingly.
I'm going to guess that the serf would generally fear his master and thus obey him, but also respect someone else, a folk leader, a priest perhaps. Or maybe not, maybe this is a useless distinction. Returning to place in the ACTUAL social hierarchy, to who (or which type) has power to change the landscapes/worlds (material or spiritual).
Avatar
weir 27-Aug-20 12:30 AM
Place and mode: If one type is powerless in EITHER world, landscape, if the other type dominates too much, you get PAIN mode. Although this isn't quite right either. Again. The interaction of Place and Mode. If a type isn't getting what it needs from the world/landscape, it enters pain mode, movement away from pain (or lashing out at the thing causing it). In agrarian types this manifests as slave morality, resentment. Desire to change the landscape to be more in accordance with their natural state.
wonder if I can state succinctly yet. Slave morality is agrarian types in pain mode, lashing out because they are in an unacceptable place within the social hierarchy of society which shapes both the physical and invisible worlds.
basically that
so many connections still unexplored, so many branches that might vanish into mist. a very shaky hypothesis, but I think it's articulated now, at least.

You point to a very compelling idea, namely that of three evolutionary niches. The nomadic, the agrarian and the aristocratic, which is a nomadic character ruling and defending an agrarian society.
This is historically accurate, I am quite sure.
The nations the rose from the ashes of Rome were ruled by invading northern barbarians, with their populace being local civilized Romans.
The Northern European barbarians themselves were created the same way. Dynamic steppe nomads invaded farming societies that had established in Europe.
An individualistic, restless, dynamic core inserted into a stable and efficient food-producing society
European nobility was enormously fertile in the middle ages. They produced more sons than their social class could give positions, so aristocratic heritage trickled down, influencing the traits of the population more broadly.
I am a product of this process. French nobles fleeing the revolution. Too many sons. One of them, left to his own devices and excluded from the connections of the family, would have many children with various women of lower standing. The children invariably successful, but no longer regarded as aristocracy.
In Asia, this apparently was not the case. I don't know the primary data, but it has been argued.
It's clear that some traits are common in Europe, but less so in Asia. "Main character syndrome", risk taking, individualism.
So there is this gradient of heredity, where people have different proporitions of serf and noble origins.
Individually and across nations, civilizations.
And philosophies arise within that matrix, appeal to people in different ways.
I think Slave Morality is intimately tied to Nietzsche's notion of True World Theories
Distrust of revealed, experienced reality, in favor of a hidden, "true" world. Paradise.
Dualism.
The other notion you point to, seeds that aren't allowed to grow, fish out of water, embryo out of the womb.
Is not the aristocrat, taken out his subservient agrarian matrix, simply a barbarian?

bjorn96 27-Aug-20 10:33 AM
Also related to passive and active coping. The selection that has happened on human neurotransmitters after agriculture began include serotonin receptors which appear to be related to this, passive coping.
But it's not straight-forward. Creating an imaginary "true world" or "promised land" is a way to induce passive coping. But I see it in aristocratic types, as a way to say "things are bad right now, but later I will have my destiny"
This can often turn vengeful and exactly resentful.
Resentment comes from ambiguity between subservience and mastery. A deep feeling that one is destined for greatness, clashing with an environment telling you the opposite. Or deep inferiority, clashing with an environment that tells you you're equal, no less than anyone.
This distinction though, between a "deep self" and an apparent, temporary reality, is itself slave-like.
Abstraction in general. Reverence for authorities with no concrete manifestations.
Distance from the border. Distance from nature. Distance from the unknown, the source.
Nomads never stray far from the edge of the known, they are never sheltered from nature by peers.
The ruling class, when performing their duty, is like the warrior class, near the border where society meets nature, the unknown.
The ruling class cannot defer to ready-made instructions or norms. Justice and fairness means nothing, because their superior is not human.
A ruler, an artist, an intellectual, a soldier, an explorer. These all share this proximity with the exterior.
This is analogous to the development of complex organisms from simple ones. Organisms made of a single cell, or a single sheet of cells, have no need for a transport system. Each cell is in direct contact with the outside and can get its own nourishment.
In a complex organism like a human body, most cells are far from the exterior, isolated by the structures that keep them safe, the walls, the skin. A highly regular, highly predictable, highly organized system is necessary to transport the source of life from outside to all the cells.
The cells are made completely interdependent, completely subordinated to the whole. The nervous system then evolves, as aristocracy does, to rule over the pacified masses, by retaining the direct relationship with the outside and the unruly dynamism that comes with it.

Fish out of water. The aristocrat and the barbarian. Within my general theory of stable types combining, interacting, to create great civilizations, I would say that the barbarian is the "natural" state, the aristocrat is the fish out of water. Boredom was a huge problem. Look at literary tropes you see often in American media: A self-made man, enterprising, disciplined, rises from poverty through his own determination and ability. His sons are wealthy, privileged, but for that reason are terrifically unhappy and often turn to debaucheries and distractions. Bees swarm, and I think young adults from prosperous families have this urge as well. Young adults need some sort of quest, I think. Mormons do this well. College tries to fulfill this desire somewhat, or has been directed towards that. Aristocracy is just easiest to point to in terms of hereditary type, has a clear role in civilizational structure. Just to clarify, was not suggesting that everyone else was agrarian-type. I do think there is a gradient, but I also think there is both less mixing than might be assumed AND preferential selection of traits between classes. And in addition, I think many early Europeans were not pure agrarian types, especially not northern ones, just scattered bands of non-agrarians later sucked in by the civilization-machine.

weir 27-Aug-20 02:12 PM
"Things are bad right now, but later I will have my destiny." Passive and active coping. Waiting as a strategy, or simply drifting? I do think there is a feeling, could call it resentment yes. A similar cause for both types: a gap between one's position in the landscape (s) and what one feels to be correct. I am interested to analyze, break down the different manifestations of this. Obviously the resentment of a slave is different from the resentment of a master. Different outcomes desired. But this bothers me somewhat: Or deep inferiority, clashing with an environment that tells you you're equal, no less than anyone. They don't feel inferior, I don't think. I need to understand it better, but they want to bring down. We would see this as inferiority, but it's REALLY important not to slip into mixing social hierarchies, values, in terms of position within pack, tribe. The two types have DIFFERENT value-systems, different expectations of how their tribes or societies will be structured. Infinite hierarchy permits total equality in subjugation to an almighty authority, the eyes of the aggregate are the eyes of their god. Anyone who seeks to rise above, anyone who doesn't conform is anathema. Not allowed, not approved of. Don't rock the boat. They seek to homogenize, equally inferior. I think. I really want to understand it better.

weir 27-Aug-20 02:24 PM
And this, your characterization of misalignment of the master type: A deep feeling that one is destined for greatness, clashing with an environment telling you the opposite. is this really resentment? It is certainly a gap between one's position within the landscape (s) and what one knows to be right. And if it is resentment, towards what is it directed? The environment, I suppose. But I don't think it's passive, not at all. I want to see an example of this, I don't think it's a parallel to slave resentment. In addition, I don't think the slave resentment manifests as passive either. To construct an imaginary world and then dwell within it, turning away from reality...this seems very active. Activity turned inwards. Still thinking about this, I want to discuss it more sometime. I want to know more about the neurotransmitters, you had mentioned them before. Curious to know what effect diet might have, wheat farming etc.

I like your description of society as a complex organism, the walls, the skin. The border where society meets nature, the unknown...thinking about this. What if nature is actually more close to the "known" than society is? Thinking of a specific type of story, of a few movies I find compelling, where the hero is lured from the fold to play with the wolves for a while. Good guy joins outlaw band. They almost always end up rejecting the wolves, but that isn't the interesting part. There is a MOMENT in these movies, a decision made to leave safety and become a rogue, an outsider, a moment when they are accepted by the outlaws because of some sort of act, some very dangerous act. Known and known. Desired/expected innate, that's playing with the wolves. Your use of known is closer to predictable/understood, observed. So I'm thinking of a different type of known. I want to think about it at a smaller scale, are agrarians generally insulated, when they are living in their own patterns? Insulated from reality? Hello!

it used to be aggressively social, move in and they bring you banana bread, neighbors party together, BBQs. and the kids would ALL play together.
now, it's aggressively NON social, you're not supposed to make eye contact, live on a street two years and finally meet your neighbor. Kids don't go outside to play.
Two kids next door, don't even know their names. Waved at them once.

When you are calm, can you easily conjure a mental image and hold it more or less still?
Avatar
weir 27-Aug-20 05:15 PM
cool book!
a mental image still, no, not really
I get vivid flashes when I think of something, memory.
visualizing something, I can do that as well, but it has to be dynamic somehow I think
I can visualize tying a knot, or a maneuver I want to make in hockey, visualize how something will react to something else, but it has to be dynamic.
If I tried to hold something still it would lose its detail, become less vivid. Details would change. I think. Wavering.

Noise/chaotic energy in the visual cortex
and strength of the top-down signal
(really front-to-back, not top-down, in anatomical terms)
I think mental imagery is a superb biomarker for general state of the nervous system
one that is immediately subjectively available

If I can't hold it still, is that a lot of noise?
Avatar
bjorn96 27-Aug-20 05:30 PM
Most likely, could be a weak top-down signal
It would feel different
If your intention feels jittery that's the top-down, if it feels like the image just won't be held still, that's the visual cortex
Avatar
weir 27-Aug-20 05:33 PM
oh interesting. Hm. I wonder which. Trying to think. Usually I don't need more than a flash, it's not important that I have a consistent image. So it might be partially top-down.
Avatar
bjorn96 27-Aug-20 05:34 PM
yeah, was thinking weak top-down due to there not being an urgent motivation
however, you'll notice a big difference across different levels of arousal, anxiety, etc
Avatar
weir 27-Aug-20 05:36 PM
the flashes themselves are extremely vivid though. lol yeah, probably. thinking about anxiety. that was what bothered me the most about it, initially. Would get stuck on something. Imagine stuff. Definitely a different amount of attention.
I haven't practiced visualizing stuff, not intentionally with visualization as the sole purpose. Usually trying to shut down if I'm actually paying attention.

I didn't like what I just wrote, I'll write you something else.
butterflies. When I was a kid there were butterflies, tiger swallowtails. Would land on our blue plumbago, a giant round thing full of sky-blue flowers. Tiger swallowtails, very big butterflies. Yellow and black stripes, they have a beautiful black stripe in their wings that swoops into a narrow "tail" a tapered point. If I was still enough they would land on a flower and I could carefully slide a finger beneath their feet so they perched on my finger while they drank blue nectar.
monarch groves. monarchs are common in California, we used to go to the monarch groves. Orange butterflies, orange and black and gold and white. Not as big as the swallowtails. They have staggered migration patterns, a relay race, going up and down the coast. I think. Yes, a relay I checked. Anyway, they would come stay at particular spots every year, and they made this one into a park for visitors to wander through. Tall eucalyptus trees by the ocean, almost always overcast. You could smell it. They would come in droves, thousands of them, clustered on the trees like it was autumn, the only autumn there is for eucalyptus trees which are evergreen.
another kind of butterfly, don't know the name. Similar coloration to a monarch, not as big or bright. Would see them sometimes, we had roses, lots of roses and they liked them. But one day some sort of strange wind blew in, and with it an entire swarm of these butterflies. Stood on the steep hill, dead summer, no grass left in the pastures. Dusty. Heard a shout and looked to see them coming up the hill, hundreds, thousands. I don't know. The air was dense with them, they twisted up and over the fences and the fruit trees, spiraled around me. They flew up the hill for a few minutes, streaming past, circuitous for such a purposeful flight. And then they were gone, never saw anything like it again. Color in the summer, butterfly forest-fire.
Forest fires. Wildfire season was nearly a year-long event, but it always reached a crescendo sometime in the late summer months, smoke lingering overhead, the sun small and yellow, shadows diffuse. Would spend hours outside, preparing for a threat that might never come. Clearing brush and grasses, raking leaves away from buildings, pruning trees so there wasn't any "ladder fuel." The whole canyon would attend meetings, bright fliers, black letters on neon announcing details of the closest fires, the best techniques, the emergency numbers, procedures.
eventually we did have to evacuate, one got too close to the canyon, the winds changed and it came for us. Big white clouds rose up above the mountains, the fire spreading fast, calls going out to leave within the hour. Dad running down the hill, he never runs, only one other time when I came off a horse. Day shattered, basketball forgotten was going to take it to the park, meet friends in town. Priorities shifting, parents deciding things, calling numbers for help to get the animals out. People who would come with trailers for the goats and the horses and birds. Some of the goats didn't have collars, they were too young. I remember thinking of this and leaving to find twine, blue and yellow hay-baling string and braiding it quickly, don't hurry or it will tangle too much. Braiding it quickly, made collars for the little goats. Didn't think about anything, just suddenly there was a list. The cats. A stray cat, feral. I found her and stuffed her into a carrier, on to the next thing.
Later as we were leaving, some of the animals already taken by volunteers, the rest behind us in our trailer, I learned that my dad and my uncle wouldn't be coming, would stay to fight the fire. I had been cold and angry, and worried that they might remember me that way, broke out in tears, three seconds at most. Forgiveness for their transgressions, sorrow for mine.

weir 27-Aug-20 08:32 PM
The fire came and went, eventually we returned, the animals mostly safe. Exhausted. Dad and uncle begging us to bring them ice cream as we returned home with the dogs, goats still staying with friends who had land. Early breakfast, stopped at a restaurant, got the thickest piece of ham I had ever seen and I ate it all. Dog wouldn't wait quietly in the back of the truck, she wanted out. Didn't understand the city, goat dog. Protected the goats, lived with them. Beautiful and sweet, let baby goats jump all over her, barked at night to keep the mountain lions away. We tied her up in the patio of the restaurant, she was happy, sleeping. Some guy, another customer got a call and he went out to talk on the phone, smoking. Came back and he kicked her, she woke up from the nap and mouthed at his pants, a little nip. "Dog bit me in the ass," he was sullen, surprised. Little girl at next table asked what an ass was, her father informed her it was impolite. Nothing else came of it. We went home. Ice cream. Dad and uncle wore guns, there were banditos around, fugitives. They had started the fire, apparently. Squatting in the forest, a drug operation. Everything went back to normal after a while. My watermelon plant had died while we were gone, half a week? Nobody had watered it. A small watermelon, the size of my fist was all that was left of it, I ate it. Rubbery.

When I was three, we lived in the city. My parents got goats in the backyard, mostly because my dad had a vision of living on a farm, a homestead, but also because cow milk made me sick. We got a goat named Cinnamon, and I loved her intensely. Cinny. Her milk was richer than most milk you could buy, very creamy because of her breed. She was a grumpy bastard, grim like a gunslinger. Walked around with her spine-fur raised up and her head tilted, her tongue out just a little. Lived in the city, the suburbs. Not much space, neighbors didn't like the noise. Mom trained Cinny with a supersoaker, water gun. A toy gun for kids, spray each other in the summer. Big purple thing, all plastic and hideous. Orange, maybe yellow? She would keep it in the kitchen and spray Cinny whenever she would start yelling. Goats can chunter or they can YELL. Yelling was not allowed. Later we got another goat, and this one wouldn't shut up, every afternoon she'd start up, something about dinner maybe. Cinny knew not to yell by then, but she also knew that yelling produced water, and she hated water with a passion. She beat the shit out of that second goat, every time she started yelling. I think I saw her bite her once. We got rid of the second goat, gave it back to the owner.
Once Cinny was trying to take a nap and digest, so I climbed on her back like a horse. She got up, irritated, and I fell off, down, all two feet. Close to my height then, I think. Unhurt. Didn't try again, goats are bony, uncomfortable.
When I was five we moved house, between the suburbs and the farm. Stayed there for a year. Cinny got sick, there were poisonous plants growing there. Water hemlock. We didn't know at the time, city people. Stupid. She ate a tiny bit, I think. Started limping on one leg, my mom bandaged it. Soon it was the other leg. Confusing.
She was alright. We took care of her for a week, maybe two. Brought her inside, she couldn't walk. Force-fed her colostrum we'd frozen, the stuff is curative. Took her outside everyday in a sling, trying to keep the digestive system moving. Come to think of it, that was probably when she became gunslinger-grim. Some sort of long lasting damage, made her gait stiff, her tongue stick out a little. Yeah, that would make sense. Cicutoxin.
Later, after the divorce I lost my cart goat to it, frothing and seizing. Same stuff, different house. We had kept some of the goats, and one day he collapsed. Must have found some growing, a young shoot. It's usually the young shoots. People sometimes eat it, because it's a lot like carrots, they think it's "wild carrot" and put it in stew or something. Very toxic. Think I'll go. I know you can read a lot, but this is pushing it lol.

There is something I've noticed, something we have both done on occasion. At the end of a long writing streak, an explanation, a definition, (or whstever that was yesterday) there will be a closing statement. Something about how long it was, about choosing to stop. It's usually a true observation if length but I think it's an emotional post-rationalization of stopping. Like, I already said what I wanted to and I stopped because I'm done, not usually because it's too long or I'm self-conscious. The realization of length, the shyness, it happens only after stopping, so to then ascribe the reason for stopping to the self-consciousness is backwards. After the fact.

Thinking about the way I visualize, wondering how much of it has been informed by books, the books I read when I was a kid. Still read now sometimes. Adventures. Read a description of a scene and it's constantly changing, lots of new things to add. Vivid details and sensations but also a certain amount of vagueness to be maintained. I want to focus, see if I can imagine a steadier scene. Jitters. You said jitter, it doesn't do that, it just doesn't last long, my attention turns elsewhere. Fades or changes details, doesn't visually jitter, shake etc. The images are clear and vivid. Dynamic images are more interesting, can think about them for longer. Side note. Blackberries. Sometimes after a LOT of focus on something visual (very rarely, twice a year?) like one day when I picked, washed, and baked with blackberries and it took me all day, sometimes I'll SEE blackberries (or the object) when I close my eyes, when I blink. Blink and I see a cluster of blackberries on the vine. Unusual.

want to tell you a few small distracting things so they're out of the way, and I don't forget cold hands on wrists, punishing cold inspires fear protects from foolishness I liked it cause it's pretty and twisted and I wanted to think about it. Not assuming it was about me, but an interesting image, general, art. Anyway, it isn't true of me, of how I feel attraction. Never been afraid of cold from others, but afraid of my own warmth. Afraid to hurt them, distract them, take away. Shape wrongly. I look and don't touch. Afraid too, to act upon something unfounded, not rational, and thus deviate from the sensible plan. But that is a different element, angle, that applies to all of my emotions, not just love.

weir 28-Aug-20 02:58 PM
"I can't describe it right, too tunnely" utterly endearing. I think about it at odd times and it makes me grin.
couldn't find the right modifier for endearing, not even sure that endearing is the right word. but it exists very sharply, warmly. laughter, affection, recognition.
laughter. tasting her warm teardrops, I mean breasts. made me laugh, I thought it was funny.
dry jokes make girls thirsty. that made me sad almost, a sorrow on your behalf.
tenderness and latent pain. beautiful, still think about it sometimes. hurts, but sweetly.

weir 28-Aug-20 03:53 PM
You asked once if I was scared that you'd change your mind about me, and it's funny, so vague. But I am scared, to ruin a friendship, a trust, a clear line of communication. Scared, but it isn't a fear I can do anything about so I disregard it, ignore it. Would have kept the door closed for this reason but it was getting in the way of clear communication. Shared intellectual interests. I'd close it again if you ever asked. Return to sterility. I don't want to, but I would, instantly. If I am ever too much, if you would like less. I value the ideas over the emotion, you already know this.

weir 28-Aug-20 05:29 PM
Your message makes me happy. It's always a relief when you stay away, because then I don't have to hold back. Don't want to choose for you about what is useful and what is distracting, but also don't want to distract you, waste your time. I can write for an hour, something you can read in much less, at your leisure. A good thing. I don't need to stay away as much, because in a large part you are both what I am studying and a catalyst for things within myself that I also study carefully, dissect. muse. I called you muse in my notebook weeks before you said it of me. Why do I hesitate to be torrential? An extremely important question. I measure my words with everyone, because I seek to control my impact. Not always to get them to act in a certain way, usually just trying not to affect them negatively. I think about angles, reactions, ways that people will move or be moved by my input. Things I don't mention to my father because they make him worry. Things I don't say to my mother because she's confused by them. I saw a child yesterday, four, five? Walking the dog with his parents. He narrated everything at great volume, it rang across the field. POOPING THE DOG IS POOPING POOP AND PEE! THE POOP IS SQUASHED! He kept on like this the entire time, it was cute, I was laughing. But I was never like that. I asked people questions, serious ones I had been thinking of. "Santa isn't real, is he?" Sensory or sexual and I think I've always treated it as sexual. Speaking to people has always felt official, stiff. My parents spoke to me seriously ever since I can remember, I responded in turn. Everything always thought-out official. Very rarely I will lose myself, when I am tired or excited, I'll go on about a subject when talking to my mom. Sixteen and awake at 2am ranting about how planets and molecules and galaxies are the same patterns, the universe repeating itself incrementally. Manic, flowing. Expressing an idea, unconcerned. Why then, do I allow myself to be torrential?
Avatar
weir 28-Aug-20 05:50 PM
I allow it with you because I've checked, carefully, first to see if you could understand it, parts of it, then withstand, and finally to see if you want it. It's something I need. It helps me think, it's a nice way to exist. It's the process of becoming visible, dynamic. I used to get creative fits and write for hours, or draw or sing or make something and if I didn't, it felt like I was turning invisible or becoming immoveable, a statue. I'm surprised by things I write once I've written them. I think I've always assumed the valuable part of the mind was the part that thought carefully, out loud. I was surprised by the emotional part I had always discounted, the intuitive parts, the unspeaking but knowing. Somehow, also intelligent, probably moreso than the measured part. This has gotten difficult to explain. Torrential, I hesitate because I am concerned by how you are affected by it, I force myself to allow myself to continue, selfishly, because I've reasoned it out that you want data, raw data, and I can provide that. That you can sift through, are strong enough to withstand, ignore, glaze over. It's something that I need and want, so it's hard to tell if it's something helpful for you as well. And I care about you, so I want to be helpful. I intuitively want to tell you things, all sorts of things, so I do now. It's basically an experiment to allow myself to speak, to quell my misgivings. A war in my mind. And it's always a surprise when you don't hate it, when you aren't asking me, begging me to stop. I don't know if I've been treating you like a journal, or my journal like a friend. I'm slowly learning to trust that what I want to tell you is somehow relevant, in some way. To trust myself to select things of value. I don't tell you everything, I don't tell you that I took out the trash and it smelled bad. There is some sort of selection process that happens, a hidden criteria applied to things I want to say to you. So I say them. But I value your peace.

weir 28-Aug-20 06:03 PM
Which is why I wanted you to know that if you wanted it, I would tell you less than I want to tell you. I might have overestimated the power of my words, overfocused on it. But that's more or less why I hesitate, I think. I don't want to damage. Detract. And I'm always so glad if it doesn't, if you're careful with yourself, strong enough to disagree, ignore, curious to read. It's frightening. I want it so much, to tell you what I think, to exist, to be seen. I don't yet trust what I want but also don't trust the bit that doesn't trust.

late night campfire with my brothers. Subpar hotdogs, moonlight getting mixed up in the apple leaves. Rats running through branches, along fence. Superhighway, stealing across four backyards to take little bites out of our apples, I'll find them on the ground in the morning, shredded. Big ears, looking at me through the glare of my flashlight, curious, cocky. Huge spider, spikes along its legs. Web is a few days old, out of the way so its undisturbed and showing signs of wear. Big brother's gf is gonna make a cake for him, says it's "not fancy." We're supposed to watch the dog so they can go camping. He wants to borrow the hotdog sticks, likes the twisting mechanism, the wooden handles. Quiet now, dispersal. Cats want me to feed them dinner, trilling at me, talking. I smell like smoke, my hairband snapped and it's down around my shoulders. Gonna cut it again soon.

reading papers on predictive vs reactive processing
it's a sharper formulation of what we called passive vs active coping
We both love to predict, predict every molecular vibration until the end of time, but we hate being made to react
or we have reservations about it, more than most people perhaps
is the photo of the fire? Looks like a sun breaking through black clouds
Or spirit dispersing heavy gray matter that tries to hold it in
So it's always been sexual...
I think the sensory is always embedded in a sexual rationale, even abstract sensations like philosophy or science
I don't understand how you can value ideas over emotions. I love emotions. If I could do nothing but feel emotions, I would never think.
I think so that I can feel. And the only thing I think about is how I can get to feel.
I understood the spiderweb metaphor, it's so obvious and very telling that I missed it: A spiderweb is what a spider makes, it's extended phenotype. Just as cities and notebooks and railroads are our extended phenotype.
I thought of spiderwebs in connection with the old things they sit on, didn't make the connection to spiders. You can tell so much about me from this oversight.
The internet is part of our phenotype, it is encoded in our genes, was encoded a thousand years ago too.
I'm reading Koestler's "The Act of Creation" and he uses a dichotomy very similar to your Seed. E.g. genotype-environment-phenotype.
He calls the seed a "code", in analogy to both "legal code" and "secret code"
A generative or summarizing formula of something that could be articulated in actuality, but necessarily in an environment, which is unpredictable.
I think the process by which seeds are created from organisms is just as interesting, completing the cycle.
The computational essence of this is compression apps like WinRar. Ever thought about how they can make computer files take up less space? How is it possible to make a filer smaller without losing something.
The analogy being that the original file is an organism, the compressed zip-file is a seed, or at least more like a seed than the original program
You learn the direction, speed and layout of a force field, then you can produce a complex trajectory and reach a distant destination simply by picking the right time and place of departure
But this point of departure will only work until the forces change

I thought of spiderwebs in connection with the old things they sit on Cobwebs sit on old things, I had told you about cobwebs and dust and so you were primed for that connection, assumption. I'm glad you like the photo of the coals. I thought it was beautiful, nebulous. I agree that the sensory rationale is embedded, but for me I think it's been buried. I've focused on how my words impact others, not how they impact myself. I don't think the things about myself that I described to you yesterday are good. Some sort of longstanding distortion, I want to understand which parts are bad and which should stay. I did have a best friend when I was a kid, a girl I would talk to endlessly about everything, hours on the phone, all day in real life when we got to play together. And emotions over ideas...it's funny to me, so funny because it's very tangled. I mean, I distrust of my emotions and so suppress them in favor of measured thoughts. I'm trying to describe something inescapable, don't understand it well. Inhibitions, I am telling myself what not to do, not to do things I want in the short term if I don't know how that relates to a longterm goal. I don't think about it enough to have different names for the parts, everything getting lumped in together. I know I hate to be numb, to have nothing I care about, but I also tend to be inflexible once I have a goal. Like, if you were in a war, and you had a job to do you wouldn't allow the fear to distract you from it, would push through. Temporary emotions are controlled, ignored or pushed out. Deeper things, values are important. How to talk about this?? I value values? lol. Elsewhere, I'll go elsewhere for now. Ideas over emotions. I think so that I can ACT. I value so that I know what is worthy of my actions, I feel emotion when something brings me closer or further from the desired outcomes, plural. Extended phenotype, exactly. Beautiful way to put it. Cities and notebooks and all the ideas behind them, invisible world.

But the spiderweb also contains the interaction with the world, with other spiders, feedback loops. So I seek to understand that as well because it's a confusing factor. The book looks interesting. Certain cycles within groups can be steady, if it can repeat for thousands of years, that's just what the group does, makes. It would be incredibly powerful to discover the cycles for each type, the many different types. Because they combine, feedback loops of different human types talking to each other and messing with each other and you get (very exciting) weird unstable NEW shit like the internet. The stable cycle disrupted by different types. Native americans no longer follow their stable cycles, they eat white bread and get diabetes. If you know what your seed codes for you can avoid obvious misalignments with the landscape. Material and social.

predictive vs reactive processing, interesting. I am going to look it up so I have a superficial understanding. But yeah, love to predict. That's what I did with hockey, why I was such a good player. I would stand outside the rink and study opponents, learn their patterns. Emotional patterns, (aggressive, scared, gets flustered) and also visible ones on the rink, like a certain player ALWAYS came straight down the middle of the rink, no matter what. Actually, I would study my teammates as well, because there would be weaknesses I needed to avoid. Don't send a tricky pass to Joe, he can't catch passes well, stuff like that. And then when I was on the rink, actually playing, I would be thinking about all of that as I played. Wondering about reactive and hockey. To a large extent it relied on a framework I had sorted out beforehand, goals and an understanding of the landscape I would traverse. But it was reactive in a casual sense of the word, wonder how that carries over into the "reactive processing" stuff. I'll look it up and find out more, try to understand what I'm thinking about.

want to think more about zip compression, it's attached to something I have thought about before. The trajectory can be predicted, yes.

I need to think about it more but
poetry, it's compressed
frame semantics
there's a frame built around external things, observed items. how they connect, interact with each other.
but there's something else, a value-frame. internal, also built around observations, but it includes the value-judgements. is/ought.
something about aura
words with heavy aura, innate, expected, self-evident
but they differ, according not to reality, but the seed
so rain, rain is pretty. If I look outside and it's raining, I'm happy. Other people go, "UGH it's DISGUSTING outside today."
looking at the same thing, seeing something totally different
I told you that the stars, the eyes of god. they aren't a metaphor. they are a pretty name for a complex theory.

weir 29-Aug-20 04:27 PM
when I look at the stars I feel at peace, I feel hopeful, as though there is within me a destiny, if only I can find it. Uh, no this isn't the right thing, wrong angle. Stars=our highest values. Look at the stars, and your God sees you. Eyes and God and Stars...these are all complex ideas I've made small to hold. So I would have to explain all three. I will one day. I think I've already explained god to an extent, a physical reality, your own highest good. Eyes are when someone looks at you and you borrow their perspective. So if I go outside and I'm say, naked, the eyes of the aggregate frown at me, I'm not SUPPOSED to be naked, it's not allowed. You can be yourself when alone with the stars, because it's just you and your potential, your highest ideals. So if I am under the stars, I see the ways I want to be better. Not closer to SHOULD, closer to what I truly think is good.
that might be super scrambled, I have no idea
but poetry, it's compressed. if you have the same semantic-frame you know what the words mean, right? An apple is a fruit and it's a color etc. IS. no values on that. just an apple, it could be the only food you've had all week or it could be poisonous or it could be something that represents all human misalignment, but in semantic frame it's still just an apple. Values underlie the semantic frame, so it's hard to separate them, I could even be totally wrong but.
a melancholic and a psychopath can look at the same thing and value it differently
yeah? there's a value-frame underlying, and it's actually less attached to language and to external reality than the semantic one. Instead it's internal reality
so if I say that the day haunted me like mist, that gnarled vines wrapped around my ankles until I became one with the forest as the skyscrapers crumbled, the glass falling like sheets of rain, thunderous silence, quiet, squirrels nesting where people used to throw away half-empty frappe with extra foam
poetry is the secret language of souls echoing the same through ventricles
trajectory. a word is an input, how will it bounce through the value-frame? that's the marble run. the combination of the value-frame and the semantic-frame, the synthesis of the world of IS and the world of OUGHT. And the marble run is dependent on the seed, but it constructs the invisible world by inspecting the internal, a landscape is created, and the internal shines like a star, always.
I have no idea if I'm making the slightest sense to you, all the terms are underwater-words, and I haven't found the best way to explain it all yet
Actually, I don't think I was ever going to explain it to anyone, but I'm not sure if that's true. To such an one we speak. Hangs on my wall. Something I'm figuring out even though I know the answer already. anyway.
there is more to be thought about here, much more. I will again soon. I think I have to go though, birthday presents.

emotions. I don't trust them because I live in an age of illusion, and it preys upon emotion, a backdoor in. red lips. Pretty, why? signify something. Lipstick applied, no longer trustworthy, no longer signify the thing but we still like them. Plastic surgery, tits will never feed an infant. Makeup covers pockmarked skin. Age of illusion. I want to see the real world, I trust myself to judge the real world. I feel, but I keep my actions on a delay, until I understand. Trust. It's about actions and trust. I can't help but feel, and I don't want not to, although I did once. But I don't trust the emotions to guide my actions because I live in a mirror-maze, think I am going towards the exit and I run into a wall. Close my eyes and feel along. Or look, but I'm calculating angles, reflections. Watch the TV, what do they want you to think? Just an example, a lot of things are like that in a way. Values are deeper set, cardinal directions. The immediate landscape can change, your idea of it refined, the illusion dispersed or a new one forming, but you still see the mountains. But to judge the things, little things around you, emotions. Not as useful for action, I have thought. I am not sure. But trust, I don't trust. maybe this is really about (not) being reactive. that's why the delay, the desire to understand (predict) the outcomes of my actions. emotions are fast so I don't let them guide me. there is a threshold, obviously. But big things and habits, I don't let emotions direct that. I understand my actions, the reasons behind them. If I ask myself the final cause of anything I do, I generally have an answer. several in fact, my actions stack, serve many purposes. control, it's all about control. which, at heart is probably an emotion and not something reasoned-out. the desire to control my impact, my direction, to understand exactly how my actions will move me.

an echo is sound moving through landscape, bouncing, angles. Trajectories. Similar internal values leads to a similar construction of the landscape and a word echoes the same. Different values, different landscape, different echoes. That's what I'm trying to say. Poetry is compressed meaning, but can only be unpacked properly by a similar type. That's what it made me think of, your point of departure. Imperfect, words are imperfect and the landscape is always changing, auras dissimilar for most words. Certain words remain more static, hold their form better. I feel disconnected. I'm not looking to see if I've made sense, I don't know if I have. Don't have time. Cooking mushrooms and beef, and I thought about echoes.

busy day, a quiet moment. thought of something earlier, about notebooks. Old stuff I've made. Two things, actually. The first is that there might be an uncanny valley effect with old stuff I've made, like with monkeys. A ripple pattern, like a sine wave perhaps, going from me to something I'm looking at. X measures distance between perceiver and object (similar/dissimilar) and shows which is of greater relevance, the similarities or the differences. So with monkeys, they are pretty similar and what becomes important to me is the differences, I find them ugly. Lemurs are more exotic, more distant than monkeys, and what is important then is similarities (mammalian, care for their young). This is such a clumsy application of this idea, but it illustrates it somewhat. What I really mean is, I hate stuff I've written a year ago, it's cringe, it reminds me of stuff I used to think, ideas I've moved on from. But I look at stuff written at fifteen and it's no longer me at all, I can evaluate it differently. I can see beauty or feel compassion or disgust, but it doesn't quite land on me because I'm not the thing that wrote that anymore. Distance.

a boy asked me if he was strange. unguarded, I said "yes" and he looked pained. I didn't tell him what I meant to say was, "strange, to them, strange like me." this isn't supposed to rhyme. trying to describe something. Inability to communicate with ease predicated upon my distant angle, borrowing eyes so that I may inspect. Angle. Many angles, different eyes. Hard to separate what I see from what I say. Part of my hesitance to speak.

weir 30-Aug-20 07:17 AM
the other thing I thought, about old notebooks, cardboard coffins was this. I write for many reasons, and one is to understand ideas, and my ideas change. So that becomes cringe, I guess. ages poorly. A different one is to express some sort of emotion, a concept-bundle. Something that's figured out, at any rate. Those I still find beautiful when I find them. I realized that it's something I've done more than once, turn emotional turmoil into a story, a little one. this message is an explanation of an idea, so later it will be cringe to me, probably. it will be too crude, I will be unhappy with how poorly I have understood my mechanisms. I called it figured out, but it's more like known. Found one today, written on old paper. My handwriting actually used to be much neater.
I hope you have a good day

something I appreciate about greek myth, It's a reference point, a common thing, Good for explaining to others what I think. Don't have to make up my own names for a thing, like spiderweb and symbiosis and mechanism. I can say that I have sought to stay insulated from the world, that I might step forth as Athena did, in full armor. It holds so much, zip compressed. Don't have to analyze everything, break down and define. Understandable. And yet, when I have an idea for a thing and I don't know what to reference it to, I give it a name. marble run and spiderweb are names. I've been introspective these last few days. feels like it's enough, I want to look elsewhere. I got the book in the mail. Might read it, (sacred and profane) or I might read something else. I'll see. Ready for some new ideas, information. I'm so tired, not in general, but right now. A long day. going to sleep.

I think the marble run is a special case of the deer tracks
The deer tracks are a more complete, more accurate description
when left to develop for long enough without major climatic or other perturbations, it will approximate a marble run, but the marble run is a degenerate version, a parody of the deer tracks.
A similar thing, except it's different. A different thing, except it's similar. Two very different things.
Sometimes it's easier to describe what you DON'T mean, rather than what you mean
Because the thing is too vast, but it has an outline you can describe negatively
There's a whole theological school about this, that God can only be described in this way. It's also an efficient way to code information in many cases.
Perhaps that's what being Reactive is, you don't want anything, but there are things you don't want.
Being motivated by a stick, rather than a carrot.
I think the last sentence perfectly sums up what I am incapable of, and possibly you too.
The stick is external, trauma to the skin and flesh.
The carrot is internal, visceral morality, food and blood and breath
"Alexithymia is a personal trait characterized by the subclinical inability to identify and describe emotions experienced by one's self or others. "
I don't really think this describes you. You clearly can describe emotions, but you'd rather not have to.
But related to the puzzle as a whole.
Something you wrote further up made me think about the act of looking into someone's eyes. A sensor sensing a sensor sensing a sensor ... a sensor.
Reflection of a shadow cast by the mirror.
Do you feel your body strongly? Or does it feel light, white, distant? Can you feel your heartbeat without using your hands?
the day haunted me like mist, that gnarled vines wrapped around my ankles until I became one with the forest as the skyscrapers crumbled, the glass falling like sheets of rain, thunderous silence, quiet, squirrels nesting where people used to throw away half-empty frappe with extra foam

weir 30-Aug-20 03:01 PM
yes, I feel my heartbeat easily. Feel it gathered at the base of my neck, at my fingertips.
I am not incapable of describing emotion, but I do avoid it.
I've written things when in an emotional state, about an emotional state. A few strong ones, times of misery. Looking at them, it seems that I don't descibe how I feel (sad) as much as attempt to inflict it on the page.
describe a situation, from above. Physical pain and some sort of philosophical ramblings, description of what's wrong with the world, not the thing that hurt me specifically.
I'll show you.

and something here, something from after my mom had gotten angry over nothing again. something from backspace. I don't know how to judge it, judge my own ability to speak, relation with words. I know I've developed habits, rules to counteract my natural reactions to things. My mom gets angry, and if I get angry too (or cry) neither helps the situation any, so I retract, defuse. I've had to. Little brother. Hello. I am all that I am, and today is not yesterday, but tomorrow. I am all that I am, a human, a girl, sweet? Am I sweet? I donâ€™t know. Sometimes I feel bitter and harsh and cold, but on occasion I am kind. And sometimes I am angry, and sometimes I tremble with something else, pain I think. As strong as I am it still hurts when you rage at me. It still hurts when you are disgusted with me. And when your stormy rage has subsided, and you donâ€™t lash out, you are suddenly polite and calm, acting as though nothing happened, as though we are at a tea party in some elegant garden and would I like to come and sit? And I stand shuddering in the doorway, all the pain sloshing inside of me, all the hurt trembling under my skin. Like a whipped dog, like an angry tiger. Cautiously I step forward, into the room, up to the table, trying to bundle my resentment aside, trying to forgive, to trust. But scared, still in pain. And you are fine. And I am kind to you and I try not to get angry at you. I suppose we are all humans, fallible and familiar, strange and indecent. Capable of kindness and acts of decency, with great capacity to love. Capable also of senseless violence, of sensible violence, of mercy, rage, regret, retribution. Love. Pain. Hope. Tomatos! Angry! Red in my skin. Donâ€™t hurt me, be careful, my paper is thin. I hate the summer.

The deer trails, the marble run, the spiderweb. Bound, they are bound. I'm glad you noticed. I think my "marble run" holds a taint, because when I first named it that I was in opposition to something, hatred of the perversion. So it isn't a clear vision, but it is an angle of a thing, the thing I want to understand. A perverted manifestation of a good thing, a distortion, misalignment. Yes. DON'T mean. I like this concept a lot, uncertain if vastness is the cause. It applies very nicely to trying to describe something held internally. Latent. Like there is a thing inside me, looking for something. An oracle. It (and I) will know it when I see it, and know when something isn't it, although sometimes that takes a while.

The mist, the skyscraper rain. I knew you would like it, it was an example of poetry. Bubbles up underneath at all times, I wrote it in a few seconds, without thinking. For some reason I always contrast the modern/manmade with the natural. Pulling the ugly into the pure and making something beautiful. I realized only recently, but I've done it for years, visually and in writing. Photos of streetlights obscured by flowers, against clouds. Notice things, and write them down. Yellow dead end sign and golden sunrise.

I've been uneasy recently, trying to understand something. Self and self, notebooks, the purpose of writing. Think that a certain type of writing is prayer, a conversation with one's god. That's largely what backspace became. I wrote three pages this morning, rhyming, unhappy. Sorted out by the end, a peace reached. Accepting the contrast between what one is and would like to be. Not accpting, wrong word. Understanding, gaining the courage to continue. When I played hockey I would often be tense after practice, head full of mistakes I'd made. I'd sort it out when I got home, look up at the stars for a while, figuring out where I went wrong, what I could do better. Understanding of the problem must be reached before a plan can be made to solve it (a plan is wrong, a decision will often suffice). Sensory. Performative, can't inspect a problem if you can't see it. Like when a horse is lame, so you send it for a quick jog to see which leg it is. Think I may have been doing that, the jogging. Certainly been thinking about it.

I need to think more about reactive/predictive. Haven't gotten around to reading anything about it yet. I sound so serious in writing, I wish you could see my face. It interests me, exciting. I hope you'll tell me more about it one day. ah! Problem, I'm rhyming and I can't help it. Leaving, going to do dishes. Irritating when my words fall in this shape. I'd erase them, restructure, but then it would lose the integrity, openness. Blame the three pages this morning. Going.

uncertain if vastness is the cause, me too
and I thought, sentient creatures like us don't exist positively
We exist as a subtraction
We are blocking out meaningful patterns, silhouettes
Positive being is some unbroken, formless energy
but since we are negative beings, we can only talk about this fundamental positive being by omission
our silence is a reference to it

Woken by an airplane, very loud. Dark still, the fog was screaming. Thought for a moment that my fear was premonition, thought soon after "surely not."
positive being, negative. A human thing. Thing in the mind. Can't describe the right ways to live, no need to. Automatic, embraced by the world. Rituals must then be things that patch the potholes, misalignment. I'm not sure of this, just poking, exploring. Will think about it more.
Reading the sacred and the profane and it's helpful, or at least fun so far. Making me revisit a lot of thoughts, new angles. New connections to old ideas are thresholds, potential sensed beyond unseen. Thinking about thresholds, obviously. Meta.

I actually found a proper philosopher that describes it more neatly, just last night. but it meant that I often look at the world from a certain perspective in order to gain clarity, strip things apart, and that perspective has no room for values, I guess? No opinions attached.
distant perspectives
and then when I talk to people, they assume my values are there in statements that are supposed to be objective, or a subjectivity that isn't mine.

emotionless, but not quite. to get to emotionless, you have to reject things people care about so it becomes almost malicious. cold.
but about the banditos. Not a "constructed" memory, but it might be something almost like it. Kind of how when you learn a new word, you're likely to notice it again within the day.
so the boring rationalization is: you were thinking about it, might have seen it somewhere etc. didn't register much. later you saw it in something I wrote, and remembered.
that happens to me with dreams. I won't remember the content at all until something triggers it, and then I do, vaguely.

thinking about sacred spaces now. do you remember once, I told you that they had cut a branch off the plum tree in the park, a horizontal branch, bench cupped by leaves? when I found it I thought, the shrine has been desecrated
suburbia, absolutely everything is owned, boring, safe. the tree (there is a grove, three of them together) stands alone in the park which is otherwise completely sterile, endless green expanse, and the grove is an outcropping, holdout against the grey hell. a bubble. and get this, other people think so too
like a stick or a rock in a stream, debris gathers. People gravitate to the trees, I find all sorts of things there. Packets of fast food, a wine cork, a pocketknife, a pair of jeans.
it's the only place for possibly miles that provides respite from the aggregate, the branches shield the teenagers from disapproval

But funny, because it can be used for good too. You know what it is? Landscaping, things already ordered? It's not chaos, it's HOSTILE. Even worse.

sitting outside in the sun, writing things down. fragments, smalti. feel like there's something just outside, unseen.
the book is hard, distracting. too many things I've thought of before, new angles new connections.
think about little things suddenly. a person can be a sacred pole, the thing that defines the world. god-king. Hockey, the coach was like that, ran like five different leagues. I even thought it, a verbal thought in the first week "hockey god" the guy to know.
hockey was a world, a religion for me. Tribe. I walked into stores, and thought of how I was a hockey player, that was my identity I guess. To the outside world. Within the hockey world there were smaller ones, concentric rings of relation.
I know the over-energized. I was pacing, and it didn't help and now I'm sitting on the floor, trying to wrap my head around myself.
back and chest and neck. you said you would embrace me and I imagined a cloak, a blanket draped around. kindness. so sweet. and then the delay hit, the second wave. stomach drops, inertia.

My mother taught me to read. Maybe I was two, maybe three, not sure. Early memory, was supposed to read "an ant" and I would say "a ant" and she would explain that it said "an" and I told her that "an" was stupid, and I was going to say "a ant." I could read it, but too stubborn to say it lol. Mom also stubborn, we ended the lesson there. She couldn't explain the point of "an" to my satisfaction so I refused to aknowledge it.

Approach, avoidance and the conflict between the two
Motivation is tied to breath
The purpose of oxygen is to burn fuel to free energy
Taking in breath is a way to up-regulate energy consumption
Shock, fear: Sudden intake of breath
Laughter: Staccato outburst of air, expelling it
The sigh, a different way to expel it
The moan
Arresting the breath, whether outgoing or incoming, during concentration
but concentration is a transition between approach and avoidance
a transition that must be maintained by a sustained signal, preventing falling down on either side
a transition stage that expanded to become 99% of our life

Compulsions are predatory behavior. Predatory in the broad sense of pursuing in order to consume
Deliberate, conscious, reflective thought, is to balance between withdrawal and predatory pursuit
Looking, keeping the body stiff, rather not be detected yet

LV1, conscientious. My dad displays a version of this. He can't sit still if he's left something undone. The sitting here is important, when I was little he called it "bouncy ball butt." Reflection, "did I reach my goals?" He'll sit, realize he's forgotten something and immediately go to take care of it. His goals revolve around minimizing risk. Uncertainty. Everything planned, always. Negatives planned for, scenarios of disaster feared and mitigated.
Reflective, comes and goes. 1 takes the nightshift. When I lay down to sleep and I'm thinking, going over things, it will find something, a connection. Then I'll sit up, and have to write it down, check to see if it's true.

RD3 characterizes my relationship to stressors that I would like to flee but cannot. Normally my first instinct is aggression, but it's tempered by thinking it out, predicting. So when I conclude that I can't escape and I can't fight it with aggression I withdraw. It's a temporary thing. I think I do this when my mom is angry. I can't leave, I can't get angry in return because neither helps my overall goals, it isn't smart so I go into an alternate dimension, distance mode. Intuitive analysis and application of theories, perceptivity high. I figure out the thing causing her distress and I solve it. She has a fear/anger axis. Usually angry is just scared, overwhelmed. She lashes out instead of asking for help. I don't totally get the underlying reasons why, I just deal with the momentary obstacle. Different perspectives. I do this in pretty much any hostile social situation. I've called it psychoanalyzing people, stripping them to basic/currently displayed motivations so I know which levers to pull. I think I call it murderous, it feels almost malicious, but I don't do bad stuff. It is intentional, something I learned to switch on. I think. A mode, a state to solve a temporary problem. Self-directed. I am alone in this state, an agent of my (vague) goals. Carrying out a task with greater dynamism than the initial directive contained.

LD2 is probably what I would consider to be home. I'm not totally sure of that. I think of it as WAR. I think this is where I formulate goals, rules. Overcoming challenges as part of my goals and strategies. Getting stronger is a sub-goal, more powerful so I can win. I'm pretty sure I recognize it, I don't think I understand it yet. I don't understand how it interacts with emotions. This is a grim-joy state. I think I have spent most of my time in this state since I left the farm, although it might have been closer to LV1. RV4, I've written "creating values, receptive. tribe. religion+love+poetic vision. like while walking. I'm still unsure if I have a notion of an emotionally negative version of this state.
I'm still pretty uncertain about these, I don't have a full understanding of the material. Angles. I don't understand it yet. But I recognized it, or at least it made me think of SOMETHING, several types of existence which seemed to fit.
I feel like I'm missing pieces. Making some sort of leap, something not understood, out of reach. But this is what it made me think of, and I've shown you although it isn't ready.

I had also written this last night, a version of it, edited for clarity. My kipling's questions revolve around action, I've tried to apply them in this way. For me, specifically, I think this is how they interact. 4 tells 2 what is good overall, (WHY act) and 2 is in charge most of the time, makes goals and strategies according to those specifications (WHAT action will be taken). The goals 2 has made are transmitted to 3, who can figure out how to deal with temporary things, smaller objectives (HOW to achieve goals). 2 serves 4, and 3 serves 2. 3 is an agent of a lord, a samurai. 3 figures out the details of short-term task, an assassination, so 2 can look at the big picture and form a strategy. 1 proofreads and oversees. 1 takes the nightshift so 2 can sleep, but will wake 2 if there is something outside of its scope. 2 is a captain, 3 is a samurai, 4 is the thing that knows (seer?) and 1 is...I'm not sure, I didn't think of a word for this.

Thinking about "shoulds." Passive absorbtion and then adherence to external values which don't reflect my own. Something I hate, can feel them and it disgusts me. External pressure away from what I really think or feel. Common sense compels me to know and avoid crossing social taboos, but they aren't MINE and they don't reflect what I care about. Related to 4 maybe. Feel/have felt trapped by them.
Avatar
weir 01-Sep-20 05:59 PM
"passive adherence" to externally generated rules (both things supposed to do and to not do), not something I do. Something that I feel physically repulsed by. I adhere to them in a calculated way, or not adhere but am aware of them, of how other people will react if I break them. Related to getting offended? Passive adherence might dictate genuine offense on behalf of social taboos, active walk around suggests caution without feeling attached, not offended by violation. Idk, I might be in totally different territory now.

what is your experience with it? the way you feel now, where would you place yourself in relation to idea/goals?
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Sep-20 07:36 PM
I am the second. Unable to. waiting for the right moment to jump, but it never comes, you get stiff and tired, the processing deteriorates.
But also just an underlying bodily feeling of tiredness. My inability to simply rest is what I would characterize as the mental state
its as if I am waiting for the right moment to jump past my exhaustion and win
staying tense, watching carefully
idea/goals
What I think is really important for framing this issue
is the notion that "emotion", "self", "goals" etc, beyond the immediate sensorimotor experience, are not (for us) actual entities, but predictions, inferences about the organism generating our experience, which we only know indirectly
they might be actual entities in a philosophical sense, in underlying reality, but what we experience is not the entities
When we feel we have a goal, we are making a prediction about long-term hidden forces beneath our own consciousness
not directly experiencing the "goal", whatever that is
Which is why we cannot choose what we want, but must discover it about ourselves
Do you agree with this?

it happened about six months into the year that I realized it was a possibility. I was on junior varsity, wanted to get even better. that was the next benchmark, I guess. I didn't start with it preformed.
it was a way to measure the underlying driving factor, much more vague, just "getting better"

improving at hockey was the truly involuntary thing, I think that making the team was just a way to measure my improvement.
I was absolutely taken by hockey. It was unplanned, I was just bored.
making the team was opportunistic, and also related to my current level. just the obvious "next step."

I think we tend to miss how our goals ultimately are completely constituted by single experiences, imagined scenes, visceral reactions (auras)

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Sep-20 07:51 PM
comprised of. Insofar as we are limited to our own experience
I am not quite making clear what I mean
Imagine youve met someone only two times
You have an experience of who they are, but there is a sense of distance
eventually you will get a more full idea of the person, but they are still an autonomous entity that cannot be captured by your experience.
I think goals are the same
and we are wrong to conceptualize them as being more internal to us than another person
maybe it isnt clear why this is significant. Maybe I am just feeling a path forward to an idea and this idea itself is kinda self-evident
I think so
Avatar
weir 01-Sep-20 07:54 PM
I understand what you mean now.
internal. I use this word a lot. what I mean isn
isn't something that's known, sensed. you have to discover it.
but it
shit lol
it's internal in the sense that if you took a person, completely isolated them from social feedback, they would still be able to discover goals and values.
the last man on earth could still walk around for a while, lonely. that's what internal means. that it's ultimately held within, and hopefully reflected by others (external)
Yes, I agree. goals have to be discovered. forces that move us, inexplicable. in interacting with the world we discover things.
this is such a clumsy way to put it

I wrote something down yesterday, about shared god being an illusion in that way. Same as the "self." something I've been thinking of. An individual projects their values onto a thing called god. And the people around, they affirm the thing called god, make their stated values explicit, shared. Reflected. I can see this in my head a lot better than I can explain it.
it's ever-shifting
an approximation
proximity to the "internal" good, beauty.
and sometimes the communal agreement chafes. It did for me.
I have to go do something but I'll be around, if you message me I'll see it. I can't think of the right way to put this concept right now.
I'll return to this, it's important. I do agree with you, I just don't know how to explain it yet.

You know how animals will sometimes chase things if they appear to be running
It's clearly not a top-down thing, not a "goal"
"It's running from me, so I guess I must be chasing it"
Babies will cry when hearing another baby cry, as if they think it is themselves
Most behavior is done without conscious awareness of the higher purpose, even if you yourself specified that higher purpose
And the highest level decision making process, by which we discover our most long-term goals, is also such a bottom-up process
I used to try writing novels by starting at the beginning
I made so many beginnings
Now I believe in the process of writing whatever appears, wherever and whenever it is in the timeline

higher level structure emerges naturally from it

like a schizophrenic train of thought
I would summarize what we have discussed with this
In principle, there is no knowledge, only belief. Beliefs are tall, but never deep.
Tall as in, fit to a large amount of data on a lower level
But "deep" only describes the hypothetical cause-in-itself, inaccessible to us
I think the post-modernist and relativist ideas are all basically correct and must be contended with. But they don't lead to apathy or being a cuck
when followed rigorously
They lead back to a healthy certainty and practical way of life
Acknowledging the swamp and doing something about it before building a house

sliding into life, a young adult finds a role. in an ideal world, a magic one. A role which they can improve at for years. Of course, that's only one facet. there are many others.
a tribal role can hold within it many smaller objectives in pursuit of something, and it must be somehow affirmed by the tribe.
an example?
blacksmith. apprenticed to the blacksmith, progress eventually to master, teach other apprentices. lasts the whole life
and it's constructed by tribe, the desire to be useful fulfilled, people look at your work and say, wow thanks!

bjorn96 01-Sep-20 09:07 PM
Yeah, the source of evaluation
I think the mind is a vast network attached to three fundamentals
I will use behaviorist language, without endorsing the philosophy
Actions, Outcomes, Stimuli
There's the possible actions I can do with my muscles and organs
There are the different states of my body, sensed primarily by visceral neurons
and then there are additional sensors, vision, hearing, etc
"It fits". Patterns in stimuli are intrinsicly valuable, because they help you predict, even if nothing in the pattern has significance for Outcomes yet
Does this seem true to you?

yes, patterns help predict. patterns are literally the "imposing order on chaos" that sits at the beginning of so many religions

Do you think Actions, Outcomes and Stimuli are a basic triad?
Action, Feeling, Sensation

I think any mental experience could in principle be decomposed into potential actions, potential visceral feelings, potential sensations
of course the compact experience is something existing independently

I'm guessing it was a reflection of your stack, a sort of translation into my own terms. Beauty is the same as will is the same as feelings, internal good, the thing that judges
Sense is the same as sensation
and then there is action, and it sits on top. I think, I sat it on top. And they're always readjusting.
action generates more data to be made sense of
and the making sense, it must then be judged as good or bad
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Sep-20 09:21 PM
That's interesting and I think you're right
Two things, then a third that contains both. And the third is probably action
But it's not obvious, maybe beauty/feelings is the third
Or maybe all three interact

bjorn96 01-Sep-20 09:25 PM
Yes, sense is a human specialty
it's cortical
Humans are unique in their integration of sense with action, but maybe not in action itself, not sure
Like, our cortex projects directly to muscles
Monkey cortex only projects to finger muscles
Other animals not at all I think
All happens via lower motor centers

weir 01-Sep-20 09:27 PM
action seems almost arbitrary sometimes. oh that is very interesting. I wonder if it shifts around, action. Action might be a bit of a composite then.
seems like I'm always moving, always doing something, can't stop. that's taken for granted. But sometimes I decide
action might be an illusion, tied to the "self"
god I sound rarted

I thought about exactly this lately
We need a new theory or philosophy of action

To exemplify how it's wrong, just think about the notion of "doing nothing" and how little it means
and how hard that is to do

I think you're right
When I described assumptions as climbing a tree, I really meant in the sense of a tree, not a "logic tree" or something.
although I also meant it in the sense of one of those towers you build, where if a lower level proves to be false, the whole thing crumbles.

We're lucky, because our species stumbled into a physical environment that happened to be a strong metaphor for some fundamental law of the universe
In one class I'm taking now, we just worked through a proof that is really cool
An algorithm that deals with logical conjunctions (like Proposition1 AND Proposition2 AND NOT Proposition3)
The professor showed how all the elements of this problem can be mapped to nodes and lines between nodes
A network, in math it's called a graph. But really it's a network
And then these completely visual aspects of the network end up proving aspects of the logic it corresponds to

For example, numbers are conceptualized either as a distance/location on a line, or as a collection of objects
Or occasionally as a unique object with an identity (the ball named 4)
The common sense interpretation is that metaphors are a useful aid that comes after the "real thnking"
to explain it
They argue it's metaphors all the way down
That the metaphors are how we compute things

This process is really key
There's a general theory of brain function called "predictive coding"
It states that each component of the brain learns to predict all its inputs from other components
Then inputs that match the prediction are shushed down, inhibited, ignored
so then they only process what differs from the prediction
It's basically a process of establishing a shared default implicature

Another is that it's a state of high energy, high inhibition

Concentration of mental resources elsewhere

thinking about it always makes for tension, stiffness
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Sep-20 10:35 PM
all cognition is distributed, as in, all the components have their own mind and some degree of autonomy
that's the only way it can evolve and scale
so there must always be tyrannical top-down control to some extent
to prevent the underlings from going at it on their own
and when the commander has limited resources, he must be stricter
While a resourceful commander can benefit from allowing flexibility
but that requires lots of communication which is also costly

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Sep-20 10:37 PM
motor units are another example of what we talked about
that "action" seems abitrary and is not correctly understood
If you suddenly unload a tense muscle, it responds by slacking
what is being maintained by the nerve is not a constant state of force, but a constant state of tension
it's not "doing", but "making a certain state of affairs manifest"
and it's like this all the way up
We don't make plans by considering each muscle in turn, how we can move them and combine those movements
We just imagine an action and then the body rushes in to make that reality
it's interesting to "decide" to levitate, or teleport and watch the muscles instinctively make plausible attempts

hockey, first time I hip-checked someone. had never seen it before, didn't know what it was until the coach told me after.
and something else, less about imagination, more a reaction. My horse bolted, ran away fast and I got pulled off my feet by the lead. Tucked my shoulder, rolled fast two or three times and came up in a crouch. All the impact was taken by the rolling.
the milk and the kick were both late at night
long day, sort of flowing.

I had minor ticks when I was like 11-2

Not quite though
Wanting to do something kinda arbitrary. Not an inability to inhibit, just too much activation in the wrong place
I get it with imagery when I'm tired and too worked up
Compulsive thoughts
Was cutting and pasting sections of papers for many hours into the night and then
the sound of the scissor is very pleasant

yeah, I was very focused on the cup. the bit that was focused, anyway. Sometimes my head is elsewhere, that might have been one of those times.

They tend to whip people up around election years.
I don't even think it's about the election outcome, it's more a pressure release.
I do think we will continue to have unrest on the streets, but most of that is opportunistic sort of directionless rage. Much more concerned by the cultural elements, HR, universities etc.

To understand unrest here, you have to have a really good grasp of puritans. That's the stock. The witch burners. Multiculturalism, it's being pushed and I'm not sure why.
to what end
I think about it. I've been trying to back away for a few years now, to get clarity by looking at it sideways. Understand people before I understand politics.
Europe and America have really different populations, variations on multiculturalism though.
the migrants that come to Europe, they are a lot more antagonistic than the "diverse" populations we have here.

Democracy makes it inevitable that solid identity populations will be catered to and consolidated
turned against other populations
Other systems are not better
Only thing that works historically is to have a clear hegemonic population
Who carries the culture, explicitly
When the hegemonic population is plausibly threatened by another you get coups and riots
Many whites will make themselves the banner bearers of minorities, for power in the democratic system or for personal identity reasons, e.g. weird puritanism
But there is also a substrate of division that is ethnic/racial/religious in nature
that these whites ride on
I mean, I hope I'm wrong, but I think it's like this

In a homogenous population, you still get political and cultural games, oppositional movements. But these are superficial in a sense, they have limited ability to affect the everyday fabric of society
in some cases this can be extreme too obviously
But then there's ethnic and religious divisions
They are like an ongoing source of tension
that requires no top-down energy

yeah people don't want the same rules. and that's okay, from a really distant point of view. but if you want a functional society you need a certain amount of cohesion.
society was tribe, kin first. always.
they seek to spread it too thin
and then it disappears, it isn't something good you work towards anymore, a shared god. It becomes instead hostile territory simply a battlefield.

Another analogy is utterance-language

go back to the bacteria, you can't transplant laws onto dissimilar cultures.
cultures stem from race
basically, at root.
and laws don't hold society together very well, they are the 1%
so multiculturalism and lack of a clear cultural direction etc is going to lead to unrest, chaos.

The triad, action-emotion-sense
I realized the foundational schema of machine learning is the same triad
They call it supervised learning-reinforcement learning-unsupervised learning
Unsupervised: Find patterns in data with no predetermined goal.
Supervised: Try to predict the missing part of patterns based on a theory you develop
Reinforcement: You only get feedback in the form of "good" to "not good", try to discover the behavior that gives the best feedback
The boundaries between the three are a bit different, more deep I think.
Unsupervised detection of patterns without any feedback is sensation, uncritical search for similarities, coincidences, regularities
Supervised, where you get to compare your behavior to the desired behavior, is action, if we define action as the voluntary kind, where we first imagine and then execute. This would exclude the most instinctive actions, and also include some forms of thought that are action-like, directed
Reinforcement learning is emotion, internal evaluation. It doesn't explain itself. It just says, "it got better now" or "it got worse now". Then it's up to the other two types of learning to figure out what caused the emotion

There is something behind it, and I want to know what that codes for, how that varies between people (peoples, types). The seed, the root of morality, motivation. Expectations. Something presumably small from which complex value judgements form over time. Maybe I'm wrong. I might be looking at this backwards. Suddenly uncertain.

wanting to climb the mountains is an example I can strip apart. If thought is metaphorical, mountains represent something, they hold a certain flavor, shape. And that is the thing that matches something innate.

when I saw mountains in the distance, what was it? the height? I wanted to climb up?
because go up is easy enough to code
a small thing, not complex, can easily be innate
complex judgements can then form from that seed, root motivation.
mountains and trees are exciting
beautiful
because they hold the possibility to climb them? to go up?
just an example

Maybe not. The question of why a math proof is beautiful might be a distinct process
Not distinct, but not completely overlapping either
Value is distorted a lot in philosophy
And retrospective analysis
I think back on how joyful it was to read a certain book
But when I read journals about the specific reading sessions, it's more juanced
There's an impulse to approach the book
There are irregular moments of heightened awareness because something stood out
But the joy itself is not very salient
It's more like an absense of questions regarding good and bad
Behavior flows without being questioned
Joy is a retcon to an extent
The sudden moments when something stands out have a more noticeable physiological part you could call joy. But the notion that the whole extended activity was joyful is a retcon

bjorn96 02-Sep-20 05:05 PM
It's clear that the extended session was mostly just engaged, later relabeled as joyful. We might argue that there are small moments of concrete joy, but what if we zoomed in more?
Isn't it just that such brief moments are more quickly encoded as memories and given joy status
I think emotion judgements are always retrospective and retroactive
"I'm feeling good right now" is a dubious statement
It can only be said if you distance yourself from the moment
Which makes you less qualified to make the judgement
Avatar
weir 02-Sep-20 05:08 PM
does it? I don't think it's a bad thing, it's just how we work. but it isn't how we think we work, so we get suspicious.

To judge your emotional state you have to encapsulate the moment and place yourself outside it
Avatar
weir 02-Sep-20 05:10 PM
that isn't judging the emotional state, that's creating it
that's judging the experience
thus creating an emotion
I think
This has been sort of framed by engagement though. Intellectual joy, focus.
I do know that memories are recoded, re judged over and over again though. Retcon? Like an update.
a happy memory can sour
a sad memory can be less important
stuff like that

bjorn96 02-Sep-20 05:14 PM
But when looking at your emotion, talking about it, even if it's "at the same time"
It's a judgement of a memory of a judgement

weir 02-Sep-20 05:15 PM
that might be why it's hard to describe emotions with words
as opposed to others simply observing them as they flit across your face
looking at a bug and you
're interested
but then someone asks you to describe that
and you have to come up with an answer
granular, fleeting. emotions are small things, quick.
but looking back, you quantize, normalize. place an average on it.
Avatar
bjorn96 02-Sep-20 05:18 PM
I think the disconnect is even bigger
Like how a symbol can be defined by what's missing, the white space
The emotion is that kind of negative space with lots of activity
I don't think it exists, it is only inferred as a force and then imagined as an entity
The individual components exist, but they don't feel like the feeling
There is some other kind of force that is invisible to us, behind our actions
And we approximate it with the idea of emotions as a kind of superstition
Like, lobotomy actually did cure depression. They lost the ability to initiate behavior
Could no longer perform their suffering
A common sense view would be that they were still miserable, just couldn't express it. I don't think so
You take away the behavior pattern, you take away the retroactive analysis, there's nothing left of the emotion

weir 02-Sep-20 05:23 PM
but there is a difference between performative emotions like smiling and complex value judgements like "that was a really useful book"
the latter, that's "good" that's judging something by it's proximity to something else, maybe multiple things.
still not sure how that works, really.
but there's something inside, below, unconscious and that's what judges things as good or not. motivation.

weir 02-Sep-20 05:27 PM
well firstly there is a matter of scale, eliminate that for a better view
time-scale smiling is a quick thing. usually. so make the complex judgement about a quick thing, not a whole book
thinking
There's something really important here, a distinction.
I will use spider.
If I am alone and I walk into a spiderweb I remove the spiderweb from my face and go about my business.
If someone else is in the yard I will usually yelp, involuntary.
Things are quieter when I'm alone, EXCEPT for things like pure joy, mathematical joy. Pouncing.
I still judge things as good and bad, but it's more of an intellectual judgement, not something I feel as much.
but when reading a book and finding a really useful idea or connection, I will grin. Shoots through me like electricity or something, not physically, but something very vivid.
or even just turning things over in my head
not a book
an idea, a spark. exciting. Or something funny. I will laugh at things I am thinking of, just thought of.

It might represent all the types, I'm not sure
I read about it in relation to comic strips
the guy who did Peanuts, with snoopy. Something about how laughter comes in response to something we don't understand, or when there isn't anything to understand... A subversion of expectation.
so you could set up a joke in the first two panels, and then in the third, there's no punchline. you don't know what to do so you laugh.

The expectations part is right.
But it's not that we don't know what to do, that is not sufficient

Being surprised is a broader category
I think it's a shift from being predator to prey
Being active, the interrogator to suddenly looking behind your back, but it can't be genuinely scary
That's why laughter also diffuses social conflict

Pursuing a comic strip is predatory
Hiding in the bushes, not moving anything but your eyes
Piecing together sensoriea
Sensory signals
Waiting for the moment to strike, the intended meaning
When suddenly it jumps on you instead, from outside your field of vision, there's a quick physiological reaction of changing into escape mode. It affects respiration, muscles, everything. If this is then immediately halted because you recognise your friend, it sounds like a laugh
Rather than a scream

The victim typically laughs as long as it's not too scary

laughter in the presence of others is used
it displays something to them

It's true in general that every physiological reaction that reveals our inner state will be used as a social performance if we can control it

Replying "hmm" when someone says something

Avatar
weir 02-Sep-20 06:14 PM
It almost feels like pulling my head back a little. When something is undermined. Actually, I may be thinking of something else. There is a tension between what is, and what should be.
Irony recognizes an instance of that. Or what I'm trying to describe, anyway. It acknowledges something.
it's kind of like when you realize something is messed up, and then you kick yourself for caring about it.
that one's like a conscious rejection of being sad
I get it when alone as well as the eureka moment, the victory. Both make me laugh.

To me the prototype of irony is to tell someone something so stupid they should understand you don't actually mean it
Not stupid necessarily
But so limited
The focus of your utterance is what's missing from it
That way you draw attention to it, the absense

LD2. I think in the paper they mentioned desire for social control? I'll find it, I might be wrong.
Drive for reward is associated with social dominance, aggression and reward-motivated persistence.
that's the use of irony, malice
it's social dominance employed in the realm of ideas, concepts. It's aggressive.
"you think this, and I think you should think something else, and I'm giving you the chance to figure that out by illustrating your error, and if you don't get it, I might then attack"
the gap between what is perceived to be, and what one thinks it ought to be.
that's what I'm thinking of, the essence, mechanism of it.

weir 02-Sep-20 06:42 PM
yeah, okay. so this is what I was thinking of, all the way back there. The thing that makes me laugh when I'm alone, the one that isn't joy, victory, eureka. when I am thinking about the way the world is, society or something, and I'm thinking about a way that it's wrong, and I think it ought to be changed, thinking of a way to fix it. That's malice, which is the motive for irony, the desire to close the gap, to change something. And then from my angle, in this situation, alone. I realize that I've already decided against worrying about it, that it's beyond my control, and I give up on the desire to fix the problem, and it's a release. And it's a little sad. It is absolutely like pulling my head back. I was focused on something, but then I remember not to be, that I had decided not to care. Reorient. Prey gets away. Stress laugh, painful, bitter.
that's the conclusion of that thought.
but the more recent one, I want to keep exploring. Irony, when used on others. Social dominance, drive for reward. Desire to close the gap. Socrates.
malice occurs when the gap between what is and what should be is recognized, like when you think someone has the wrong idea, and you illustrate, using irony, the gap. the absence. you show them where they are wrong, it's a kind of threat. Drive for reward, social dominance. Pursuit of an idea, a truth. That's the reward

if it's merely melancholic, sad, then probably not suicidal, quite. Depression is safer than anxiety.
lethargic

if she laughs and falls back down later, if her neutral state is sadness, it's safer than with anxiety. More time to act, not as risky. I think.

With anxiety, it's sharp, very sharp. Suicide is gets you away from something painful.
Depression is dull, can last for years. Suicide with depression, I think it's different.
Depression can be momentarily mitigated, the danger isn't the sudden escape of death, so much as letting yourself fall into disrepair.
I feel strange talking about this because its so important and I'm so uncertain.

And zinc helps to bring down, calm things. Helps you think.
There is a point between being low on zinc and getting genuinely anxious where it's a bit like being caffeinated. Hyper, lots of energy. Desire to create, more emotional, more artistically minded.
I take zinc supplements now. I had physical symptoms of deficiency, like white spots on my nails and stretch marks. You need it for skin. My mom went looking for nutritional elements of anxiety, that was one of the ones she found.
It's much more complex, zinc is kind of a building block, starting point. But without it, people get anxious, and I'm guessing a little stupid.

You know how we distinguished between what must be said and what is just understood
It's a hierarchy. "My son's father came to visit me in the hospital today."
At least three levels of new information
Ugh I'm confused but
Every sentence has a highlight, the new info, and then the background
"I hit him." "I HIT him" "I hit HIM"
The highlight is the apex of new information
The rest just establishes where we are in the implicature
Can you imagine a map and transparent sheets with map elements on them?
The transparent sheets have elements that are identical to places on the map, you slide them over and find out where they fit
But they also have new things on them

Dawn, sky is pale. Pink and yellow. Peaches. Nectarines. I wanted six of a sunset hue and they gave me five dawns and a peach.
think the sun is just beginning to rise now, cresting the mountains, or maybe still behind. The city is breathing, I hear the cars.
We had a dog named Goldie, and she looked after the goats. You know her already. She sat still and she bit someone. We didn't always intend for her to be the goat dog. When we first brought her home she lived in the house. But she had too much energy, and would beg to go out at night. Would break out and go running halfway across the mountain to chase things.
She corrupted our first dog, a black one. He had no ideas of his own, he looked after us kids. He only left our side to chase the cars along the fence. But with Goldie, he would also go running across the hills.
One night they encountered a skunk. The smell was terrible. Goldie, more intrepid, had taken the brunt of it. The black dog slept on the porch but Goldie was sent to the goat pasture to air out. She was unhappy at first, smelled bad, kept to herself.
Goats have social hierarchies. The herd queen, the big boss of the time was named Tilde (til-duh), and she took pity on the smelly dog. Licked her off, cleaned her up and kept her company. Protected her from the other goats, acceptance. Goldie never came home after that, she was happy with the goats. Spent all day in the pasture, and at night we locked her up in her own cage with Tilde and she barked at raccoons and mountain lions until the sun came up and the monsters went to sleep.
The sun is up now, yellow light hitting trees.
I'll go for a while, circle back and leave you things.

mountain lions will consume the femurs, nostrils, and skulls of even their largest prey, but think fur is nasty and will spend up to an hour plucking it off by the mouthful before opening the thoracic cavity to consume the heart and the liver and lungs.
they leave tails on the ground after everything else is gone. Tails, and a pile of fur, and the upper jaw with its palate.
We only had a mountain lion kill one of our goats the once, this is mostly from the internet lol. I may have spent part of the morning looking at pictures of deer corpses.
Mountain lions don't like the digestive organs and will often take them out, carry away from the corpse, and bury it.
They come back to the kill for days, eating and napping. When they are done eating for the time being, they bundle it up, wrap the hide around the rest like paper on a sandwich, and they cover it in leaves, loam. They don't eat their food where it was killed, they take it to a safe place, a tree or a rock or something.
The one that killed our goat stuffed it into a corner of the fence under a toyon tree. Mountain lions like roads, paths. They will often walk along them.
When I was little, the first few years we lived in the wild, a mountain lion jumped up on top of the roof of a little porch attached to our house and grabbed one of our cats, ate it in the backyard. We found a single bone. The same one that killed the goat, I think. They are very territorial. My bedroom had two windows, and one of them overlooked another, larger porch. I kept it closed.
Seven, maybe eight. I had a dream that one came to eat me as I was playing near the old oak and the tire swing. In my dream I ran all the way to my room, and rushed to close the window. It was too fast for me though, and it jammed its claws in the crack, just before it came down all the way. Became humanish somehow, pushed the window up and climbed into my room, stood there on two legs and calmly explained that it needed to feed its young, so it was going to kill and eat me. I woke up in the dark, and imagined a parting phrase, "I'll come when you least expect it" and somehow that dream haunted me for years. Silly, right?

Once a rattlesnake got mad at our dog and my little brother. A big one, loud noise. Little brother was so small then. We climbed up a fence, tall metal corral panels, and our mom pumped it full of snakeshot. Rattlesnakes can bite you even hours after they are dead, you don't go near them for a while. We actually didn't encounter that many rattlesnakes, other places have many more. We had an abundance of king snakes, and they actually eat rattlers. They are resistant to the venom. California king snakes, black and white ones. Very bold and pretty. Used to come by in the same places every year. One liked to sit just between the doormat and the threshold, so you'd step right over it and do a bit of a jig. When you walked, you kept your eyes on the ground. It took me a couple years to drop the habit once we moved to the city. I remember I was walking along, looking at cracks in the sidewalk, and realized I could look up instead of at the ground. No snakes in the suburbs. I looked up and it was dizzying, sidewalk stretched ahead so far, tapering.

Okay, so I wanted to send you this. It's basic stuff, and not really my place, but you might be able to find some value in it and pass it along. I don't know, do with it what seems right to you. If you want more info I can get it, this is a simple overview.
I've been thinking about depression, and I don't know if this is helpful in the slightest, but consider these breadcrumbs, harmless ones. In facing a difficult situation and suffering with mental health, often some basic physical things can help. They won't mitigate the situation itself, but they can help you cope with stressors and feel more optimistic about finding a way out. These are things that are commonly linked to depression, nutrients missing from the modern diet, or issues caused by the modern lifestyle. They aren't dangerous, and they will likely help. If she's gone through a lot of stressful stuff recently (move, new job, etc) then she's likely low on vitamin B12, which is commonly deficient, VERY important for functionality, energy, mood, and is depleted with stress (as well as caffeine and alcohol). Vitamin C is also helpful, and it's really easy to get, even if you don't want to take supplements (just eat more fruit). Also, magnesium, SPECIFICALLY magnesium bisglycinate is helpful for brain function and can reduce stress levels drastically within as little as a week. If she is agitated, this would be a good thing to take. You can get it in gel capsules, which I recommend because the powdered stuff is honestly revolting. Vitamin D, omega 3s, and proper sleep are all helpful, if somewhat more broad. And exercise is also VERY good. It even provides an outlet for anxiety and aggressions. Also, herbs: lemon balm, great for stress and digestion, totally safe, makes a nice tea. L-theanine is extracted from green tea and can be taken in capsules or as gum, this is more refined, so not as harmless as lemon balm, but it is still pretty safe, and it does work well on acute bursts of short-term stress.
This is kind of a scattergun method, but depression is multifactorial, usually a good chunk of it is physical. Any of these would help a little, if she's low on any specific one it will help a lot. None of this is meant to make her suffering seem less real, it's just basic stuff that can cause predictable issues that she doesn't need to be coping with IN ADDITION TO her stressful situation. If she's willing to take supplements B12 and magnesium bisglycinate are the best options here. B12 is common and likely, mag bis is a real heavyweight in terms of dealing with depression specifically.
That's all, I just thought I should send it to you. I've known about all of these things for a long time, and I did some basic checks on their usage in relation to depression as well. I've taken everything listed here at one time or another, my mom is really into supplements. It's all safe. There are reasons, complex ones behind everything here, and I know a good chunk of them, but didn't go into it for the sake of brevity. Anyway. I have to get some sleep. Have a good friday. Don't know if this is helpful, but on the off chance it might be, I thought I should send it.

Tell me about skating
Avatar
weir 04-Sep-20 01:15 PM
Skating. Rollerblades, but not the ones usually used in urban settings. Mine are special, designed for inline hockey. Compact boot for agility, wheels are close together. Waxed laces to keep them tight, no readjustments while skating. I wear little black kneepads and fingerless gloves, not because I think I'll fall but so I never have to worry about it. Summer is good for skating because the ground is dry, it gets slick with fog or rain at other times of the year. I go to the school, the parking lot and the entry road. It's empty at night and in the mornings. No debris to get jammed in the wheels, I go fast. Last night there were stars and dark shadows outside the lit areas, out across the field, in corners. I spun around, pivoting again and again, got dizzy for a second, stopped. I go fast around corners, make little circles. Up and down the strip of road. Backwards too. I'm probably better backwards than forwards. All the defense lol. I can skate on any surface really, but I love the smooth ones, baskeball courts, tennis. I stay off the ones here, but the cement of the road is good quality, new. Wheels make too much noise, I need to clean the ball bearings. Dusty, grinding. A rushing sound, and they feel gritty when I'm skating, not as smooth. Slower, if you spin the wheel it should keep going for a few minutes, maybe 90 secs, mine stop too soon from the friction. Tall when I wear skates, I process the world difderently. Used to have a few really tall teammates and I never noticed that they were tall when we were all wearing skates. I've spent so much time skating that I know exactly what I can do, how fast I can go, agility, corners. It's all there, fully internalized and available for calculation wihout conscious effort, so it feels like an upgrade. Superpowers. Maybe driving is like that, I don't know. I didn't do enough driving to find out, the car felt heavy, had to think it out manually.

weir 04-Sep-20 06:46 PM
right, so animals have instincts to do things
that's why I was reading about mountain lions
because I was reading S+P and it made me think, the descriptions of how houses are built, sacrifices etc
like, to build a house is to say "we're gonna stick around here for a while"
it could be a tent, a temporary shelter
a house is just an extrapolation of that
so you kill something, a sacrifice. let a bull lose, build the village where you kill it.
it isn't reflecting the gods, as much as the gods reflecting basic animal instincts. I think.

When goats give birth their mothering instincts (oxytocin?) are largely triggered (or at least directed) by smelling the birthing fluids on the baby as she cleans it up. Just realized you might find that disgusting. Um. Anyway, if you clean the baby off instead of her, she might not recognize it. If it's a cold and windy night you can mostly dry the baby and then just rub some extra on for her to smell and clean off. Same with rabbits, you don't touch the babies for the first few days while they're still figuring it out, getting used to the babies. Smell and instincts, instincts are motivation, basal ganglia.

Etymology elucidates, these are metaphors people have used. Theories.
Spirit means breath originally.
The idea seems to be that something invisible animates, creates movement and life in matter
like the breath

Postmodern art, they tried for a while (I think) to discover what "art" was, they removed things to see if it was still art

they removed colors, removed form, removed human agency

William James formulated a philosophy he calls neutral monism, which is pretty much what I've always believed
That it's incorrect to reduce matter to mind or vice versa
Anything experienced is real
Thought, sensation
Mental and physical are distinctions within this matrix of experience
The overall picture could correspond to that matrix, or it could be thought of as mind
But I think it's most accurate to formulate it as an eternal mutual containment
Mind is just matter. And matter is just mind. Etc
This wheel is the most satisfying metaphysic I've found so far.

She relates being at the doctor
"Why not wait a few years, maybe you'll find a man to have a child with." He said.
Most of all, it provoked me.

Tweeting is almost like a tic
There's a long-term justification but
I want to use the platform to reach people at some point, but I know I'm not ready to. So at this stage it's just a tic
Two different ways to generate a new thought. One is by analogy to a previous thought you've had before
This will be quite boring
But that's what I usually do
The other is difficult
There's an experiment I read in a cognitive psychology textbook years ago
Try to write down a sequence of digits, make sure there is no pattern in it
It's very hard. You start making little syllables, 2-9, 4-1 or something

I was just about to say
There are two types of dopamine receptors
D1 targets dendrites, the connections between neurons. D1 is quiet and slow until it suddenly bursts. Then it remains active for a long time. Salience.
D2 targets the neurons themselves, the cell bodies. D2 is fast, on-and-off-and-on. Interpreted as reward.
I think D1 encodes the ground and D2 the figure
the field and the particle
the melody and the chords
Not necessarily these concrete things, but this fundamental structure

Dopamine is not reward, because there is no such thing as reward.
Reward is defined as "something an animal will work for"
And so dopamine receptors (D2 specifically) will be sensitive to "being willing to work"
But that just means acting
Acting, not on habit, but some kind of choice or at least desire
Every aspect of behavior is entangled in that
Avatar
weir 07-Sep-20 01:31 AM
d2 just tells you if you're on the right track towards other, bigger things
is x like y, y/n d2 would be the y/n maybe
Avatar
bjorn96 07-Sep-20 01:31 AM
I think it's primarily an energizer, an agent. Only secondarily a messenger
It does something, imposes a pattern. Then, since it behaves in predictable ways, the rest of the brain will learn what it means.

thinking of training animals, of how behaviors are shaped over time from lots of smaller behaviors encoded, stacked, and grown complex.
a pattern
interesting
so it's involuntary and then you think about it?
Avatar
bjorn96 07-Sep-20 01:34 AM
From a certain angle you might say that the action of dopamine constitutes the locus of voluntary choice.
It's unclear.
Basically
Ancient parts of the brain that don't seem to have much sensory input will shoot dopamine up into the more developed brain
I'm not sure how they know when to
But when they do, it causes salience-reorientation in some regions (D1)
and something like a reward or a signal to keep going in D2 areas
to go with the standard description of it
So the part that has all the sensory input is being led by a part that is blind
I guess it's extracting sophisticated patterns of interoceptive states
inner state of body
There are feedback loops, sensory clearly reaches those areas, but probably only in a very simplified form
I'm very manic right now. I don't like how my sentences end up.

girth
midpoint
he had to reach back

and then for years afterwards he would reach around there
whenever he knew I had food

How we tease out the superstition from the efficient action is interesting
and this is sortof that
He didn't need to lean back to get food most the time
But it was part of the bundle of actions that led to the outcome
Avatar
weir 07-Sep-20 01:44 AM
little behaviors stack, become complex ones, and that's a really fun part of training an animal, because you have to look into the future, form a causal chain of desired responses which will eventually lead to the outcome
and then work to build it
clicker training
you want the horse to go into the trailer (it was a donkey actually)
so first you have to get them hooked on the target, the thing that they touch wit their nose to get a reward
and then you take that away, you no longer reward
until they take a step forward, then BIG reward, huge
eventually you get them in the trailer
they don't want to go so you reward even just one foot on the ramp to it
it's slow
anyway
boring sorr

Avatar
bjorn96 07-Sep-20 01:50 AM
Then I'm thinking, is this kind of shaping representative of how animal behavior is generally built up? I don't feel like it is. I think behaviorist experimental set-ups generally misconstrue what's going on inside the animal's mind
If you imagine yourself with a gnome
You can't really communicate with it
It clearly wants you to do something and will reward you
You play along and do what it seems to want, but your behavioral output is very simple relative to what you're capable of
The channel of communication between the animal and human rewarders/trainers is so small and this is the bottleneck on the complexity of the learning process
While in the wild learning is much more dynamic and artistic I think

even not training
but situations

clicker training specifically is good because it causes a panic when they don't get the reward
and they offer all kinds of stuff
because they really want it
expect it now
without it they are unhappy
and then it offers the ability to pinpoint with sound exactly when the behavior occurred.
do it a couple times and they figure it out
would work the same way with a gnome

"strong easterly wind" it said earlier
checked the weather and instead of sunny, clear, rainy etc. it just says smoke
and apparently the power might get cut off as well. They have been doing that in Portland, shutting down power. Something about fire risk.
Go outside and it's fine, it doesn't smell that bad. And then you get something in with a breath, a small piece of ash and it stings, hurts in your lungs, throat.

There were things like that.
Our canyon did a bbq once a year, huge potluck.
Christmas mattered to me, birthdays. But it's a little one-sided.
The family sees most holidays as a chore, or an excuse to eat. Stresses them, obligations.
I end up trying to help it limp along n my own, but it's not...magical.
The new year that we first came to oregon, it was snowing.
I went out by myself. I do that now. To look at the fireworks, wander in the dark.
Fourth of july I walked across the city, through strange suburbs, people sitting out on their lawns, happy to see me. Got to a field from where I could see the skyline. Pretty.
The new year was magical, new year, new city. Evergreen trees at midnight, snow coming down softly. Green flashes of light.

He starts a very bland speech, then he stops, hesitates and goes "Actually, this feels a little too rehearsed. How about I just say what's on my mind?" He puts away the notes, etc. And this is how he performs it as well.
A rehearsed transition from explicit formality to false authenticity

I know that its being used to change people's behavior on a really large scale, so any science behind it is likely cherrypicked a little. And the popular talking points are mostly garbage, easily dismissed. Would have to separate.

the whole picture of Nazism actually
I'm a little biased towards anything provocative, I'll admit
but if you look at how Napoleon was portrayed in British media
I don't think Nazism was some epitome of evil. I think both WW1 and WW2 were about hegemony in Western Civilization, fought between Anglosphere and Germany. The loser always looks bad.
The victory of the Anglosphere took us in a certain direction that everyone now seems to hate. All the attempts to find a "new path" more or less resemble the futurist-primitivism of the Nazis
So I think there's just a deep tension in Western society between these two paths
But it's not something I know deeply

I tried to find commonalities with Nazi Germany and also fascist Italy that weren't shared by other countries, even current ones. To answer the question, "why are they so bad?"
best I could come up with was basically direction. Nationalism as opposed to globalism. Everything else can be eliminated. The jewish stuff is largely obfuscatory, can be dismissed with comparisons to modern islam etc.

So I end up looking at other factors. Morality, innate psychological traits. How that operates within the current system.
And what large forces are driving the current system, I mean almost external ones. We've never had this amount of connectivity before, it's unprecidented.
It's causing human patterns to scale, display themselves, repeat in very large ways. It's also causing distortions. Pretty sure there's never been this amount of power concentrated. Little things can make huge ripples now.
I don't care about jewish stuff, it's just a visible area of a huge underlying system, one that people tend to concentrate on because it's so annoying. It's a red herring, or a tide marker or something.

I think European jews have mental traits that are part of the explanation. They are very succesful in academia and business. They're very neurotic and often paranoid. At least the ones I know are like this and it conforms to the stereotype.

Think that disease must be understood as an element in a personal reality
Not treated "from outside" with reductionist tactics
So they'll emphasize mental and social stuff
And when they think of society as a whole, it's not in a utilitarian way
their thinking is permeated by metaphors with organisms, rather than mechanisms

I think it might be a natural result of communication technologies, as well as how they are held. I'm not sure yet, not at all.
But even if it is merely "capitalism," profit as the sole driving motive, and you take into account the idea that big corporations dislike free markets,, what we have now is a system of superstructures, and the human influence cannot be discounted

It's a free market if you widen the playing field to include governments.
concrete examples
First, understand that big corporations are risk averse. They don't seek to maximize profit, so much as sustainability. tobacco industry. Big corps actually like the taxes and regulations, because they can withstand them more than the little corps.
so imagine there's a big boat, huge. A ship, a war ship.
and it's being attacked by a bunch of smaller, more agile, friendlier looking ships. Maybe they sell nicer food, idk
the big ship is going to go under, or at least make less profit
but then it figures out that if it creates a lot of ENVIRONMENTAL pressure, like huge waves, the smaller ships will sink
so it lobbies the government for taxes, rules, endless bureaucratic nightmares

we dance around it, unspoken, because it's important. Or I do.
I have something that drives me, or maybe pulls me forward. A desire to do something, one I constrain until I have enough information.
I see a system that could be so easily moved, rippling out and out. A scale previously unimaginable.
I see a gap, a world of misery. Miserable people are useful people, they will do much to avoid it.
Everything I look at seems more grand than it's ever been before.
It's like no one has noticed.
And when I look at something grand, I look at my own opportunity for agency. And I look to see how I can escape it, fight it, move within it. Reshape it.

I will think carefully, because that's a large question.
First, it's looping. Things are judged differently.
I've tried to explain it before as two aspects, proximity to good (fruitfly good) and consistency between models and new data.

weir 10-Sep-20 02:47 PM
root good, star good, unchanging
can only get closer to it
not a conception of it that I hold, it's instinctive, judges irrespective of me. It's the static part.
It isn't an idea.
It's an entity.
this might not be making sense
I am something that changes. I am a trajector, I move within a world.
I spiral up
I build things, ideas. I take action.
All of this rests upon something else, motive.
Get closer to good. Do what is good.
I mean at an incredibly basic level.

something like that, I recognize the way you speak about it.
you've spoken of it before
it can be observed, it's actions can be
it's something that exists in fruitflies and goats and humans, the good.
"what" is good differs from creature to creature
and idea of "good" changes within the individual, over time
but there is a universality, in that creatures hold something to be good, and move towards it
proximity to good is what dictates action

would that circuit constitute an instinct? it's the same thing, probably, but smaller, very small. An instinct must encode much more than this, or my theory fails entirely.
It goes to the vinegar therefore, if it is sophisticated enough, which is an open question, it might judge that it is good unreflected approach and avoidance behavior comes before judgements
unreflected, before judgements
I really should have found a word other than "good"
unreflected approach and avoidance is predicated upon an instinct, something simple and internal, and that's what I mean by "good."
Bees are more complex than fruit flies, I think you can see both simple (unreflected) response to "good" (gonna call it X) and and also judgement, anticipation of the other kind of good, the wider kind.
A bee tastes sugar for the first time, and gets X.
that's simple
that's moving towards vinegar
That's all I mean. Instinct. VERSUS, complex good, closer to what you've been thinking of:
A bee finds a hummingbird feeder. It decides that it contains sugar, an abundant supply. Because sugar cues the X response, it then judges the feeder as good, good in the wide sense the sense you are likely thinking of.
the bee returns to the hive, and performs a signaling process, a dance, detailing the location of the feeder to other bees. This is complex, it has gone into the environment, received external input, judged it as "good" not merely X, but an abundant source of X and it has gone home to the other bees to tell them where to find the abundant source of X.

Living organisms come with presets, instincts. From the seed, literally the DNA, an organism grows. It has expectations. Some unconscious, maybe automatic, maybe becoming complex. But they grow in a specific way, they code for behavior and action and also physical regulation etc. And it's from these things that morality springs, complex judgements, ethical systems.

bjorn96 10-Sep-20 03:44 PM
The word "expectations" is similar to the phrases with "good", in that it suggests a cognitive process, representing counter-factuals, future states, etc.

It does and I don't want it to
Avatar
bjorn96 10-Sep-20 03:45 PM
But expectations, desire, knowledge are more complex circuits built over mere unreflected behavior
that is my view
Things can have very simple behaviors
that then exhibit emergent properties
that we might categorize as "intention" or "goal"
Like how we say that evolution "wants" certain things
This is a common idea, but it's important to take in all the implications of it
The high level patterns such as "desire", "emotion", "good", "expectation" exist in a mathematical sense, as potential forms. But they cannot act as efficient causes
and so answering any "why" or "how" with a mechanism invoking "desire", "good", "expectation" is to invoke a more complex mechanism, but concealing it as a simple entity
a transition to subject-free, purely causal language is necessary to understand. At least within the naturalistic framework I use
Avatar
weir 10-Sep-20 03:49 PM
But expectations, desire, knowledge are more complex circuits built over mere unreflected behavior
mere unreflected behavior is what I mean by good, by root good. Because it differs from fruitfly to bee, and yet is the same among each type, it shows something constant is dictating these actions.

Will raises some definitional questions
The muscle in a vat exhibits Will, but a primitive kind
all physical forces are Will, but again, primitive
I think the extent, or purity, with which Will is exhibited, depends on how cleanly it approximates a single goal
And so when electricity is organized in a hypercomplex circuit like the brain, organized into massive societies
the mathematical form we call "Goal" is manifested at an enormous scale
the mathematical form we call "Goal" might simply be negentropy
Order

Avatar
bjorn96 10-Sep-20 04:02 PM
Will creates itself through many stages
we can trace it from physics through chemistry, biology, neurology, sociology
homeostasis, replication, allostasis
means of amplifying itself
if many things are 'the same', they exert a greater coordinated force
and this is what Will makes, is made of
if a thing remains 'the same' across time, same effect
so that's replication and homeostasis
When both these processes have advanced far, there is enough stability to begin allostasis. Creating small simulacra of the external world within each organism, so future perturbations can be predicted
that way, organisms can put themselves at an imbalance opposite of the incoming shock
that way it survives it, or even benefits from it
that's where we are at now. The golden age of allostasis
Don't know what happens next
I think "expectation" applies once you have allostasis. To some extent when you have homeostasis
These terms mean the same as "reactive" and "predictive" behavior

But we can't establish any "absolute space/time" in which things have objective order and velocity
Time and space do not exist except as an abstraction over events and processes

you mentioned the unobservable (without disturbing) particles before. wave, interesting.
I thought of dust motes, flies. For some reason they allowed me to visualize it, although that isn't how flies actually work.
but it's a little like how dust motes work. you can't catch one in your hand.
a dust mote has a space around it, air. if you try to catch it, touch it, the air moves it away from your hand. that's what I thought of.
and clouds of midges on a path, you think they'll get in your face but usually they never quite do.

bees swarm in order to find a new hive, then they will often rest in a tree or something for a while before continuing
and when they do that you can put them in a box
and then they decide to live there
that's the main way to get bees
so, we went to the city for a swarm call, and these kids (my age, at the time) were confused about it, about the beekeeper suits
I told them to stay away from the bees
and one of them was like, "I thought they were flies!"

Many layers, ever changing
I'm going to revisit it
My ideas in this field are old
And I'm going to recreate the Philosophy of Neuroscience from the ground cause it's not satisfactory
Most results are transparently false, trivial, misunderstood or misrepresented by the authors
The basic findings in older papers don't permeate the new ones
Some work is shockingly good
But then not given full justice
All of this must be integrated with a philosophy of computation and meaning
I need rigour and discipline
I can't do it purely on desire
Maybe I'll fail for this reason

weir 10-Sep-20 07:59 PM
I think that meaning is transpersonal, the superego is what holds you up, keeps you steady. The thing inside draws you forward, and the eyes of others, the right eyes can keep you tethered somehow, continuous.
This is something I have sought to remedy in my own situation.

Norwegian dialects are extremely different phonetically

There are very minor vowels differences some places
No idea why and I've tried to find out
China has massive dialect differences

Car would be American. There will be a hard R at the end, and the A is different as well. Rounder in the mouth.
Cah, English. Longer, breathier. Very subtle r at the end, if any.

bjorn96 10-Sep-20 08:38 PM
The r is completely mute in English, but the difference in a is interesting to me
I think my vowels are quite off
I believe there are two very slightly different pronunciations of R depending on the sounds around it. Do you know about this?
Can you recognise it from yourself
Avatar
weir 10-Sep-20 08:42 PM
Well, if I think about their and they're, a lot of the difference is in the R, but it's signaled by the preceding sounds

In the eastern standard dialect
R is a flap or rolling sound
But before s it is mute
And the s is replaced by a sh sound
You could say the two sounds merged, but it really is just a sh sound
But it's not spelled that way, so people don't believe it when they're told that they're not saying any R

He calls it "implicate order"
At small scales, at sufficient precision, the thing being measured cannot be held separate from the instrument measuring
The observer and the object become a single event
That they both participate in
Not an interaction between separate entities
But a dissolution of the boundary
I've talked about this before

Action has two phases. First, adjusting the initial condition in order to optimize potential energy and likely trajectories. Then, release, being taken by the flow or the gravitational pull, hoping that you jumped from the right spot and blindly trusting that you did
We're still in the first phase on the large scale of life
Knowledge is transition points between different initial conditions/departure points
Once the right place to jump has been found, we become vehicles for a greater force
And then there is no doubt or uncertainty

because it isn't clear, by nature it isn't clear

If you can construe washing dishes as a meditation, tie it to ancient traditions, neuroscience, philosophy, it is easier to do
A name is better than a definition
Yeah, I agree
In this example, washing dishes could be "too small" and therefore difficult
It's below human scale

We lived with them for a few months when we moved away from california. I didn't know her before then. I think she's very far from what I value, but I was fond of her anyway.
They were often miserable.
She left him, but then got mad at him later.
I think they might be better apart, because she made him unhappy, forced him to be something. But I'm not sure, and he isn't happy now either.
I wish he'd pick different girls.

He has a track record. He wants kids one day, but keeps picking women who invariably end up just, wrong.
I don't like to be judgmental, I sound pretty rude I guess.
But it's basic. She must have been in the 300s. Not going to have the best mental health with that. Nevermind normal health.
What if the kids got health problems from that? It just seems bad.

and there are vulnerable periods, like when a doe gives birth, that you can train her to do something, allow you to milk her, to stand still for the milking.

Doorknob. Door lock, actually. We lived in the same house for a while, and my mom would go outside for a few minutes and she would never lock the door behind her. And then, if the wife noticed, she would lock it.
Eventually she got mad, had an outburst.
Accused my mom of doing it on purpose to trigger her ptsd or something, garbage.
My mom had just left the house, so it was behind her back.
She was really upset and her and my brother locked themselves in their bedroom for about two hours of fighting over it.
My mom hadn't done it on purpose, she's not like that. Incredibly straightforward. Doesn't even get sarcasm.
I guess that's it.

Infinity is a negative concept, good observation
In-finity
The absense of positive limits
Limits, edges are sensory and exist positively
Infinity is emptiness in space
Hadn't thought of that
To define is to delimit
You take something infinite and non-existent
And make something out of it
Defining things by what they are, vs what they're not
Two contrasts

I think the edge of the theoretical universe illustrates this

a dustcloud

Avatar
bjorn96 10-Sep-20 10:35 PM
It's a bug because an earlier assumption was incorrect
I think
The assumption that space exists absolutely and contains conscious agents. When in fact conscious agents experience optic flow from which they construct space as a useful model. What is outside of that is impossible, even in principle to know and even the notion of outside is likely meaningless
And so when we imagine being at the edge of the universe
Let's say you hit a wall, there's nothing on the other side. You think, "there must be, there can't be nothing"

so you go to the edge of the dustcloud, and there's no more dust, it's all behind you, but you keep going. drifting, still. once you get far enough away, maybe you don't see it anymore, or it's very small.
so then if you were to keep going, you wouldn't know you were going
you would just exist
but if you were to turn around, go back
the further you had gone
or the longer you had existed, on that trajectory, the longer it would take you to return

Grid cells, I want to learn more about them. They might explain what I'm thinking of.
Thoughts, ideas. Things tied to other things.
A mechanism is a sequence of causal relations, links.
each event understood, each part impacts another part. they are next to the parts that they impact, are impacted by.
sometimes it's linear but more often there are many strands, and they tie in at different places and it becomes three-dimensional, inter-related.

there are different kinds of webs that spiders make
the stereotypical one, the concentric circles, that's not one I was familiar with at first
I grew up on black widow webs
and they are different, they look different
more three-dimensional
the threads are very strong, that's how you know it's a black widow, besides for the shape which is distinctive
they grow in corners, so they have a lot of walls to work with, it gives more depth
very interconnected, but the pattern isn't obvious, I don't think there is one

Touch any point in the web and the movement spreads throughout

I like the web because it offers the opportunity for causal links, pathways, which are discrete, I've made them discrete. But it also allows for a certain amount of chaos, it's unfinished.

With herd animals, I think it's usually figured out right away, a period of fighting to determine ranking, and then it stays that way for a long time, until something big changes.
If you put a new goat in with the herd, there is a period of unrest.
With horses especially, there will be a leader and a few deputies, and they will bully the newcomer. The newcomer can 1) accept it, 2) overthrow them, or 3) leave the herd and be a loner instead.
I had a horse that did 2 and 3 on different occasions
and he also got his ass kicked by our tiny pony, on a different occasion. She was spirited.
2 was funny
because it was a new stable and he got put out with like ten horses in a pasture, at dinnertime
and three of them wouldn't let him eat, even though there were empty feeders
bullies
so they all went to the middle of the pasture while the other horses ate, and he kicked them a bunch until they decided to leave him alone
and everyone was mad at us, because he was our horse
but it was three against one so it was funny

I was happy about the book, because I had been writing about something I'd called "societal control" and then I saw it at the thrift store and thought it must be the same thing.
And then I realized that it kind of was what I had been thinking of, but then I also realized that it wasn't the root, it was just another layer, application.
Religion is probably closer, much closer. Prosocial instincts.

How is your discipline, do you spend much time on things you consider a waste, simple entertainment?
I do. I'm really split
I either make progress on big goals or waste time on effortless things
Small, effortful steps towards medium size goals that's hard
Avatar
weir 10-Sep-20 11:49 PM
yeah, my problem with discipline is that I just don't care much about the smaller things. I'll work like crazy towards something big, or something urgent. But it feels like smaller things, mundane things are taking away. I used to waste time on entertainment, so I cut it out pretty harshly.
I still waste time, somehow.

I do listen to music still, but it's on top of other things, tasks.

I'm engaged when I have a goal that I think is important.
I'm not really sure how disciplined people are meant to be, like if you look at primitive lifestyles. That sort of life pulls you in, along. There's always a reason to do something, it makes sense.
But for me, it's usually that I "should" do something, not that I want to, need to, or value it much.

so it was funny to see that we have been talking about it for a long time, with inverted terminology
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 01:50 PM
Yeah that's interesting
I think it has to do with the symmetry around the sheet of immediate experience
There's immediate experience, as it appears. Then thought, explanation, theory is built over it, in front of it. But it's a mirror image of something behind, underneath, the true causes
Philosophies will privilege the mirror image in front or the one behind as actual
Our confusion fits into this, not immediately sure how
Behaviors are complexities built over simple judgements. Although these judgements don't exist as mental phenomena. They exist only as selection, as implicit.
Explicit mental judgements are even more complex, built over the behaviors
Why-how-why-how-...-how
If there's any behavior at all, any more or less regular action exhibited by a system, we can infer a "why" from it
and all answers to "why" can be rephrased as the "how" to an even deeper "why"

I'm glad that the terminology is somewhat resolved. I'm glad that what I have intuited as the mechanisms for life is reflected in your words and ideas.
Because I look at a thing, and I see that. With the basic knowledge that I have now, the light grasp of sciences etc, the firm one of observable behavior, that's what I see. Simple judgements. Behaviors. Layers and layers, building up from what I've assumed to be binary, although this I am unsure of.
And I really want to know how it's encoded.
What it encodes for, how that differs among beings.

Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 02:04 PM
Defining it is a major part of the field
William James said something like
let me find it
[Attention] is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence.
That's in 1890.
But it's difficult to study, because it's close to the spinning center
It gets very close to a thing looking directly at itself
Attention being the tool we use to study it
And to define it, we must have a good grasp of what it is not, its exterior
Which is impossible by definition, can only be done very indirectly

bjorn96 12-Sep-20 02:07 PM
Yes
A mirror can reflect its shadow. By means of another mirror it can even reflect its own reflection.
But can it ever reflect its own surface, somehow abstracted from a particular reflection
Apparently, it can't help but. Simply being itself is an act of such reflection. But it's somehow insufficient for the act of knowing.
Simply being human is to observe attention fully, completely. But it's somehow insufficient.

it talks about computers and processing, the turing machine which I think of as linear
and the quantum kind, which can do many things at once
several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought
human thought is not linear, not always. I think. In the abstract sense, not the mechanically grounded one.
Humans might be special, different from other animals in that we have a bit of a war, a split.
I'm still unsure of it, the book is not intuitive to me, although it's very interesting. Tires me.

Just a second
ok I'm back
He writes from a very conventional perspective with big flaws. A tacit overconfidence in our understanding of reality. But he happens to be describing some very important stuff
And the title is actually deep
Probably, approximately, correct
Three very different, very key concepts
Linear is a bit vague. But it's clear that most thought is not linear, in the sense that it's more like a society than like a single person
If linear means serial processing, doing one thing at a time, producing a chain of events that can be traced.
A society produces such linear outputs. A single president. A single compiled history. But it's aggregated from extreme non-linearity underneath. Thought is also like this.
Avatar
weir 12-Sep-20 02:21 PM
serial processing, yeah.
I have such a terrible grasp of what computers are currently capable of, but the way my dad describes coding in the old days, it was linear, serial. There was a sequence to it.
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 02:22 PM
Pop science overhypes it. I think quantum computing is still very tentative, although it
's cool of course. I don't know it deeply
It's still mostly serial
They'll have several processers so they can have a few streams at once.
But they have to meet again, make sure they don't get in each others' way etc
True concurrency, like the brain, where a massive number of units are processing without much central coordination, and still produce an outcome that is creative and beautiful, rather than chaotic. That's the goal
Avatar
weir 12-Sep-20 02:24 PM
that makes sense. thank you for explaining a little.
I think it's really important to figure out to the extent that the brain, brains, are helped by being in a specific environment, for which they already contain directives, assumptions.
I feel like this might explain a lot of how they work so well. If you remove them from the environment, they create maladaptive behaviors. But I want to know to what extent this is true. And to a more pure reasoning perspective, less emphasis on survival actions.
I don't know if that's comprehensible lol
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 02:28 PM
it's a good direction
My next assignment in school is about a mathematical formulation of this actually
A proof that for every algorithm, there are environments in which it fails, where another algorithm would succeed
An important part of brains is stacking algorithms, so that when one fails, you can find another one. But this highly flexible approach will fail next to a rigid, "automatic" algorithm that just instinctively does the most adaptive thing
the latter kind of algorithm would fail if they compete over a larger range of different environments though

A high IQ intellectual vs someone who has done the exact same task their whole life
The latter will be superior at that task, if measured from the point where the other guy starts
after some time, the more flexible man might get better
but being "automatic" makes you superior, if you happen to be tuned to the exact task you have to do
because being flexible, "non-automatic" means you have to do a lot of processing to even determine what this environment is

Neurons will synchronize their firing patterns into rhythms of different frequencies depending on state. These are plausibly a kind of framerate of experience. Would result in experience of time changing
There are also states of exhaustion when time loses its smoothness
also interesting. It's not exactly like a framerate of course, because there isn't a central clock.

"dorsal frontoparietal network" roughly corresponds to what I've labeled "task network", "means network", "defensive network"
I think it ties in with the feeling of pursuing our own goals and ideas vs being forced to deal with mundane or external tasks
the latter often requires emulation, looking at what someone else does and then trying to do the same

I'll read the paper once you're gone
do you think the implicate is more the realm of ventral? If the cingulate encodes the periphery, it's closer to unconscious judgements, will.
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 04:23 PM
I'm not sure. There are many different axes. I keep rethinking my assumptions. But good question.
Further down there is a more clear distinction
like in the spinal cord and stuff
From dorsal to ventral: Sensation, flexion of muscles, extension of muscles
but yeah this is a major area I need to resolve into something more final, the various axes
First there's rostral to caudal. If you imagine us like a snake, it's from the nose back and down.
Then there's medial to lateral
Then there's ventral to dorsal, which some places is the same as rostral to caudal
but in the cortex, dorsal means something else, because the cortex grows out from two places like a sheet, then it folds
so ventral and dorsomedial are both close to the origin
while dorsolateral is far from where it grew out from
then there's the axis of development.
First you have simple nuclei. They develop into simple cortex with no layers
that develops into cortex with some layers, like anterior cingulate
then finally highly layered cortex, the outer parts
so there are all these gradients whose interpretations are not clear

It's difficult. I think all of the complex behavior we display is built upon smaller things.
That's why I focus so much upon the social aspect, I think it's the biggest displacement, on a large scale. I've stripped myself apart and put myself together backwards, but it allows me to move.
Avatar
bjorn96 12-Sep-20 04:35 PM
maybe it is
not sure about that
it's a nonlinear equation where it's hard to compare the impact of different parts
the physical body is a big one
if it's in a very healthy state, relaxed and energized, more distant pains are easy to bear
then purely mental, attention dynamics. They can absolve even extreme physical or social pain. But it's fragile, hard to achieve
maybe not a good thing, maybe it's deep denial, rejection of the world
that said, the social is big

If the organism is displaced, there are distress signals, and then those are rationalized differently, depending on person and environment.

Grapes grew over the windows of the farmhouse I grew up in. White and green paint, peeling because they hadn't done a good job, the people we bought it from. Big leaves shading the kitchen windows, wooden table to eat at. A ridiculous hanging lamp, almost a chandelier, almost an electric candelabra, it hung above the table and my dad would often hurt himself bumping into it while setting down chicken and potatoes, green beans, broccoli.
The land had been a vineyard once, and there were several types of wine grapes, medium purple ones with a strong taste, tiny green champagne grapes, very sweet. The ones above the kitchen window were purple, they climbed up the house, up to the second story, bedroom windows overlooking the yard. Foxes used to come and eat them, once one climbed up the vine, up near the second story.
Foxes climb well and like fruit quite a lot. Elderberry tree outside my window, and they would come and eat the berries.
The first year we lived there, our grumpiest neighbor (several lots away, a different part of the mountain) told us of a fox that had been eating his dog food. I saw it one night, looking out my window. It was very fat. I thought it must have been a lot of dog food, but later it had kits. Little foxes, they came and played in the yard at night.
That was before we had dogs, the dogs would never stand for that sort of thing. But for the first year we were between sets of dogs, our old ones had died. And the first year, the foxes were mischief.
Kids, we were careless. We left our shoes outside, the fox drug one of them off, found halfway across the pasture. Another time my big brother left his shoes out on the porch and a fox took the opportunity to despoil them.

Orange trees, two of them. And a lemon tree. The lemon tree was always in fruit, and it had thorns on it, horrible long ones. Of the orange trees, one was a better variety, the second was a juice orange. They were the best oranges I've ever had. It isn't fair to call the things the sell at grocery stores oranges, they're not the same at all. A lot of fruit at supermarkets is like that here, I wonder if it's any better there. Somehow I doubt it. I used to climb up into the orange tree and sit there, deep shade on a hot day, oranges still cold inside from the night. Jasmine blossoms look a little like orange blossoms, we had both, and a wisteria, bright green vines and purplish sprays in the springtime.

Sleight of hand. In A Midsummer Night's Dream there is a passage, a part, where Oberon, King of the Fae seeks to punish his wife Queen Titania by causing her to fall deeply in love with something odious, a man with the head of an ass, a donkey. This is achieved by poisoning her while she sleeps, the first person she sees upon waking will become that which she desires (the person being the donkey). The King's trickster, Puck, is set to do the task, and returns, poison in hand, to prove to Oberon that the task is achieved. In the version of the play that my mother took me to see when I was ten or so, the poison was a flower, a large lotus, a prop. Puck hands it to Oberon for inspection, and then there is some dialogue. But then the theme shifts, and Puck begins a monologue, juggling several balls. Oberon (and the audience) are transfixed, watching. Oberon still absently clutching the lotus. As if by accident, Puck drops one of the balls, which rolls to the feet of Oberon, (an unwelcome distraction from the monologue) but Puck continues to speak his piece, juggling. Eyes rigidly fixed upon Puck, Oberon slowly bends to the floor, eyes UP the whole time, face tipped to gaze upon the whirlwind of rhymes and movement. With one hand, Oberon reaches to retrieve the fallen ball, while with the other, away from the audience, he slowly, slowly, sets the lotus flower down near another prop, out of the way. He takes the fallen ball, rises, tosses it to Puck who finishes the monologue and the scene segues into another topic. I thought this was clever, very clever. When I told my mom about it later, about how clever I thought it was, I found she hadn't noticed at all. Like Oberon, the audience had turned their attention to Puck, and placing down the lotus could be done discreetly, allowing for the story to move forward without needless intrusion like, "how do we get rid of the poison flower."

My fingers linger in the air for a third of a second after I move them, full-colored, fully saturated. I feel my body extending many meters, some heavy mass of muscle, limbs, possibly wings, no skin sensation, but intense muscle itch and I can lift it, I vibrate and shiver violently when I find the right sensation and I'm lifting these enormous masses that have been dormant and heavy. I'm convinced now that history revolves around me and I suspect, but this is only a suspicion, that an active intelligence is intervening to confuse and mislead me. I see mountains of light and I'm headed for them. Out of the labyrinth. I don't know what it means to love someone, the speech act seems to signify more than what it signifies. I still don't believe we are destined to meet, or have each other. I think it's for the better. But insofar as what I mean by my words is what you read in them, I do love you. I love you very much.

some homicides are determined by the murderer, but in other cases, they are determined by the victim (I can't find the right word)
in the latter type
it doesn't matter as much who did it, who ended up doing it
someone got dragged into the forcefield
just as some people are born with instincts and pathways that predestine them to commit many murders
some people are born as direct threats to the world they're born into
and so the world itself seeks to destroy them or push them out of their natural developmental trajectory
if the world fails to reject the advances of this anti-christ
he becomes the world, a new world
The Christ-like and Anti-Christ-like have another distinguishing mark
He is king, but completely powerless until he is procecuted and executed
they fear him, so they try to keep him in the shadows, far away from himself
but if that fails
their fear is too intense, they act rashly
they try to step on him
if they hadn't, he couldn't have completed his transformation

in the goat pasture, we built a cage at the bottom of a steep hill of clay
in the winter the rains would come, torrential
it would all run down the hill, flood the cages, the goats would be in inches of mud and water, miserable
the water flows downhill, movement through a landscape, according to laws
take a stick, a small stick, and draw a line in the clay, no more than an inch
a protective circle
the water flows around the cages
forms a stream, it goes elsewhere and the goats are dry

I've tried to be enough, alone. I theorize that I'm not enough, need others. I rejected something, and now I'm trying to find my way towards something better.
maybe I hate myself because I'm thinking in theory, and theory always fails, or fails a lot, at least.

innocence is precious. But there's something like an innocence that grows powerful, vengeful.
not quite vengeful
innocence is fragility. Rejecting the common, to remain in a state that, for the time being, is desirable
this in itself is a beautiful and necessary theme in life
but when it insulated itself too much it's unhealthy
I'm speaking in generalities
Mostly in regard to philosophical outlook
and vision of self
There's the kind of innocence that is disgusted by fertility
I see it in you, subdued
you will not show it explicitly, but you reveal with omission
do you think I'm harsh?

Generalities are pure, their edges are cut nicely and they are clean
They're all from one source
Not a disgusting mixture
You wouldn't use the word 'pure' about yourself, but it means about the same as 'innocent' I think. Slightly different, but more apt perhaps
Purity insulates itself from contamination, perhaps because it's waiting for the True World
the stranger, or strange world that is also pure
But these true and pure things are just ghosts
There is nothing left of them if you remove the dirt
It's just that you can get used to grease and bad smells and then you stop seeing and smelling it
so that way we can make pure zones, by staying in the same place
so to make serious advances, even in theory
it's necessary to be thoroughly disgusted in the intermediate stage
I think

I've been trying. To a large extent I have. I get the urge to leave it physically, to go elsewhere, but then I think that it isn't sensible. oh the illusion, It's not me, not only me.

Nietzsche criticized the "True World Theories" of the religions. Ways to condemn life, calling it illusory, to cope with suffering. We are not evangelicals, but we also construct "True World Theories"
In part it's an actually optimal strategy. We do want to make something, change something
in part it's cope
we wanted too much, now we're in hiding
the world wasn't right for us, as you said
so there must be a balance, some right combination of affirming actual life, healing the fracture
and maintaining a transcendent ambition
and to summarize, what I feel alien from in you, is a fracture that is larger than mine
the fracture between the immediate sensory world and the imagined "True World" I mean

Avatar
bjorn96 15-Sep-20 02:36 AM
One is, you said you considered going elsewhere, but thought it wouldn't be sensible
I talked to someone else about this, a few months back. She mentioned "dancing naked under the moon". These kinds of immediate, desperate and concrete interventions are not the solution. I tried myself. "Outside" is not a physical place
This is a very natural first interpretation of the problem
but somehow, I think the tenacity and theory-mindedness we want to escape beyond is also the pathway that will take us there
Some purely spiritual or phenomenal transcendence will not have a lasting impact
look at the 60s kids, they eventually just grew old
inspired no one
now their spirituality is a joke

it must have the rigor and physicality of theory, but it must be united with our fertile, animal nature
we err on the side of too much theory, too ethereal
no flesh
no fear
physicality was weirdly applied to theory
reading it again, I think it obviously belongs to the animal nature, but what I mean is
immediate physicality ends up disappearing, it can't last
while the abstract, mathematical ends up lasting, it's immediately ethereal but physical across centuries
Those were my additional thoughts

I saw you and saw an other, an other like me. You're a part of my theory of how to be human, how to live. I want you to touch me, shape me. Need it.
And in turn. But my theory is cold, you don't like it.
Away from the theory.
very simply, I think you have similar values to mine, somewhere deep. And so you can look at me and see what is beautiful and what is ugly, and when you tell me, I find that I agree.
Whereas with most, if they tell me I am beautiful or ugly, I do not see it as they see it. It doesn't land, and I am not touched by it, not shaped. I find it mildly amusing, usually.

From the first, I have thought of the story of psyche, dripping hot wax, an impatience. That's why the promise. A strategy. I don't move without purpose. But the purpose has grown past that somehow.
at first you were insubstantial and might disappear, and I didn't want you to. Because there was an imbalance, I had been watching you and already formed an opinion, but to you, I was no-one. So I wanted to be careful, not to scare you off. Just in terms of talking to someone, I mean. I didn't intend to fall, I wanted the conversation.
Wanted to test myself against you. And you seemed to be hurting. Foolish? Perhaps. Outgrown its usefulness.

It's all that matters I think. Children. Everything is encapsulated in them.
Anything good that can be said about a person is either about their role as lover or parent

my parents divorced, my dad lives in california
he has a longterm girlfriend and she wanted them to live together and he didn't
she was lonely I think, bought a house to live with her kids and her grandkids, instead of an empty condo every night
it seems sad to me, extremely pragmatic on his behalf, but not realistic. he says things like, one day they'll be old and have to move in together in case one of them falls down
it seems horrible
he talks to my little brother at five pm every weekday evening, and he gets monosyllables, so he is playing the same video game now, they play together, and he's getting a glimpse into my little brother's world
meeting his friends for the first time
hearing him swearing, he's shocked, disapproving. trying to parent him, counsel him towards being more cool and polite
my mom and my little brother and I, we live here in oregon, and she's somehow given me carte blanche and I don't understand it. She never sees anything wrong with me, and it's actually quite hurtful, I think I'm not seen. But that isn't the point.
She's so mad at my little brother over little things, and he's too uncaring, he won't stand up for himself, until he explodes at her.

the other day there was conflict about cereal. He wanted some, she thinks it's unhealthy. I was the one placing the order, and I eventually just got it and said they could argue about it once it got here.
she thinks he's lazy
basically she wants household chores to be done
but never actually articulates any of them
and she's too busy with her own interests to actually do any
she doesn't keep house
she simply doesn't
so I do things voluntarily, dishes and tidying, cooking. but then she's surprised when something else is left undone.
or, she buys groceries haphazardly, no plan or anything and then gets upset when some of them invariably spoil, blames it on him for opening a can of beans or something
it's ridiculous
I love her, I do
but she's not good at the whole housekeeping thing, it's like she hasn't figured out that it takes effort, planning.
and then she gets upset by it, scared I think, and that translates to anger at others.

I think she might think that I am her superior, she'll say things like that sometimes, that I'm smarter than her. It hurts me.
When I was a kid it was strange, she never praised me. It was part of her philosophy.
And now, I'm something she brags about, she's proud of me, but I haven't done anything yet, to be proud of.

It's a type of bragging because it's always about how glad she is, that she raised me the way she did.

It was mid-divorce, moved away from the farm. It might have only been my own insecurities, but I was thrown into a very different kind of life.

weir 15-Sep-20 04:43 AM
ah
he was nosy, sort of overly concerned, asking if things were okay. that sort of thing.
It probably had a lot to do with my own insecurities at the time.
because of the animals we were renting farm land
and we kept having to move
for some reason
a string of bad rentals
moving every year for a while
eventually landed in a place where we lived in a camper trailer while refurbishing an apartment to live in, and at that time it was embarrassing to me

my teammates were all wealthy, and my parents were too, my dad makes good money, but land in CA is very expensive. in retrospect the animals were a terrible idea. It was awkward to be the outsider in terms of being the girl and being homeschooled, but the camper in addition was a bit much.
It could fit in their living rooms.
I don't feel that way now, but I was insecure then.
Defensive of my mom, because things really were pretty bad. She was stressed and she got mad a lot, and I was fifteen and suddenly in charge of keeping things smooth.
Had to because my little brother was heavily affected by it, and there were things that had to be done, animals to care for, hockey practice to get to.
I couldn't afford to argue with her and have her say, "oh, I'm not driving you to hockey."

the smoke has cleared somewhat. Out of the 400s, into the 300s. Last night I saw the stars peeking through for the first time in a while.
I don't know why I'm writing to you, exactly. But I wanted to.
Today I will be doing a lot of school. I have a few assignments I want to finish and turn in. I have to remember not to get stuck in them, not to care. I try too hard, and they just want good enough.
Now that the weather is cooling I am considering hiding my blankets. I want to know if I can acclimate to the cold. A passive trick to up my metabolism. I don't know, it's probably stupid.
In the winter my breath fogs in my room in the mornings, and then in the kitchen, looking for tea. In the winter I make a lot of soup.
Before the smoke came, we had tomatoes growing in the garden, and I wonder how they are doing now. I don't think anyone's watered them. Although I've also heard that you're supposed to not water them, towards the end of the season. Forces them to ripen. Maybe I'll check on them later today.
Last night I moved the rabbits outside again. The garage was good for a few days, with the big ashes falling. Now though, it's only smoke, and the neighbors go out in it all the time without masks. They were happy to be outside, they like the nicer cages. The ones in the garage were small and cramped.

the current state of the hypothesis
Avatar
weir 17-Sep-20 03:25 AM
I'd like that
Avatar
bjorn96 17-Sep-20 03:26 AM
the assumption is that there are two rough levels of behavior and cognition
one is "within" the model, predictive, goal-driven behavior, where you have an idea of what might happen
the other is "outside" any model, it's what kicks in when something completely unexpected happens
or when you give up on a model, look for something else to do
So "model" can be a task, a goal, any system you care about understanding in a given moment
In this framework, it's important to estimate the probability that you're completely wrong, that you can't win within this model, that something totally unexpected will happen, or that the answer you're looking for can't be formulated in the current model
This can depend on the system, it might be too complicated. It can depend on your model, it can be too picky, trying to be too precise. It can depend on the environment and your status in it. If your status is low, or you're in a dangerous place, the probability of something unexpected is always high, regardless of what system you happen to be looking at
Serotonin takes part in coding the probability of the whole model being wrong, or irrelevant, or something outside it being more important
More specifically, it codes for how high you're willing to let this probability get before you quit looking at your model
An autist would have elevated serotonin. They will keep looking for an answer within their system when most people would step back
Low serotonin would be a neurotic person. OCD. This is just a prediction of the theory. I haven't checked if it's true.
That's serotonin. I think I'll wait with dopamine

bjorn96 17-Sep-20 03:40 AM
I will write about dopamine too or I can't focus.
First a note
The brain is a community of networks and this will cause paradoxical effects. I speculate that high serotonin will cause sensory percepts to "linger". It causes fragmentation, because various networks will accept greater incongruency with other networks. So you'll get a fragmented feeling, like the visual scene isn't very coherent, messy
Thoughts will get repetitive, not meshing together into a complex though, just many smaller ones
But if they do form a larger coherent one, it will be very stable
Serotonin builds walls and keep the order
so whether it's unity or fragmentation, it keeps it from changing
I think tunnel vision requires high serotonin
Dopamine
When you are trying to model a system you care about, whether from a distance or while pursuing it physically, dopamine codes for this dynamic, within the model
It jumps the moment you enter the model
when you first decide to try to model something worthwhile
And then it fluctuates in a way that is closely tied to your accuracy at predicting the things that matter
But here it's not as clear yet
My suspicion is that dopamine codes for a decision to try to increase your accuracy. That means getting exactly what you want, when you want, getting all the predictions right
It means being picky
This is achieved by creating more complex models, merging larger networks together
Visual field becomes beautiful and focused
Thoughts are very deep
And to achieve higher accuracy, it's necessary to increase sampling
when your model is more ambitious, it becomes harder to tune, so it's urgent to sample way more than before
so it causes exploration and pursuit
Value-seeking behavior can be seen as a way of reducing uncertainty. It is commonly seen this way in neuroscience. I'm not sure if the idea is intuitive to you.
The idea is that the brain "predicts" that body temperature is within a good range, that nutritional values are good etc
The mismatch between the "prediction" (desire) and actual sensory input is what causes behavior
behavior is an attempt to reduce the prediction error
This way, perception and action are the same
Ok
That's enough. I will answer any questions, but I will put a limit on my writing now

I was just outside, bringing in tomatoes and purple beans from the garden. There's a storm coming, I can hear it. Thunder on the horizon. White sky but still full of smoke. Sun isn't even setting yet and it's orange, tangerine. So dim that you can see clouds moving across it like the moon. I stood and watched it get swallowed by them.

Yeah, and facing a lot of resistance to spending so much effort on something foreign
and so it's strategically interesting and I learn a lot
At one point I had ran into the same few concepts I didn't understand so many times that I felt sick thinking about them
then I got increasingly impatient and rigid
so the only way to approach the task seemed to be thinking of those exact three concepts
in the same stereotyped way
Then I withdrew, found ways to shock myself, forget everything. And I pursued the whole task as aesthetic exploration, finally got into absolute flow

I think action precedes perception. Both in evolution and in ongoing life. Sometimes we can act, knowing where we are (and maybe even where we want to end up)
But often we must act not knowing where we are
Not knowing anything at all
Any system of ethics, when subject to sufficient abstraction, must rest on a decision with no knowledge behind it
Any knowledge, any probability distribution, when you skim away the assumptions, becomes absolute uncertainty
It's the old joke that "it's always 50/50, either it happens or it doesn't". But in principle that's not wrong

You adjust
letting in different amounts of gravity in each direction?
Avatar
weir 18-Sep-20 03:25 AM
not really, maybe. I guess it was just the concept of something which causes a sense of limited direction, I've called it a maze as well.
It's something people build in their heads, a representation of external conditions, quietly judged and internalized.
society I guess
I wrote, "normal is the matrix"
people follow the rules of their social group somewhat. predestined pathways.
It's simple really, I just want to see how it works, why.

not close to the experience of dying
but as if this event had happened to me
in a kindof narrative, social sense
Avatar
weir 18-Sep-20 03:48 AM
I don't think it's uncommon to feel distant from death
there's a sort of horrible normalcy that surrounds it.
my great grandma died, and we went to attend the funeral, stayed at her house with the family. Just my dad and I.
And it was full of her things, and people were just taking them, no real respect. Being portioned off, an old telephone, jewelry, a portrait of her.
there was constant bickering about nothing at all
and at the funeral my dad's brother was a mess, weeping and my grandma mentioned that he took it hard and my dad was offended, because my dad was actually the closest to her, he's just not demonstrative
it was so ugly, all of it
and suicide, it's got an extra layer of ugly
maybe that's not what you mean, I don't know

I think that people aren't as used to it as they should be. It's a serious thing, but it depends on who they were to you. Everyone dies eventually.

The thing about that woman, you might find this funny too
we didn't know her very well. I got invited to her place along with two of my friends. We brought some alcohol. Turns out she has a small kid.
Something very wrong, a crossing of frames
Then we just relax, put away the alcohol
And at some point she mentions that she writes
And we encourage her to read some
And I don't remember anything, but I remember thinking it was really bland, absolutely nothing. But we all complimented her
again I can't put my finger on it, but
there are so many absurd things about the whole acquaintance
everything is crossed, dishonest, not really real

weir 18-Sep-20 04:04 AM
I think some people live in a certain social dimension, stuck in it.
too harsh always, sort of very casual as a type of socialized mannerism
the alcohol and the child reminded me of this, but it might fit as well.
there was this girl I knew from hockey, she was a year or so younger than me
her mom worked for the national guard and they were on some sort of welfare as well
this girl, she was always really affectionate, but it was an affect
she constantly lied
her mom was a single mom, drunk. dad was in prison, never part of her life
and this girl would literally throw herself on guys, always talked in a super cheerful way. too excited about everything.
sixteen and she was smoking pot and dating some shady, fat 27 year old guy, looked like a mole in cowboy boots
I talked to her because she was the other girl, even went to her house. took care of her when she got a concussion and her mom was too drunk to take her to the hospital

I went to her house one halloween, and the girl had another friend over. Just like her. I was more serious, they weren't touched by things.
the mom came home from going around the neighborhood to different parties, and was super drunk, yelling
said that she'd had a bunch of vodka
and started taking off her clothes, got in the shower. it was raining really hard outside
the girl didn't seem embarrassed, she just shoved her into the other room before she got naked right in front of us, and the mom was yelling about wanting nachos

Want to tell you that I miss you badly. But also want to let you breathe, I'm being needlessly needy. A little torn over this. Continue as you are, I hope, this isn't a request to be comforted so much as a confession, I want it off my chest. Enough that you know, don't need you here. But I miss you. Is it a weakness to miss you? If so I have been weak today.

weir 20-Sep-20 03:15 AM
It's the bad kind of missing you, and it's a little odd, because usually I am content when you are quiet, peaceful because I know that you're alright. But the problem here is not that you are quiet, but that I'm unsure if I am supposed to be. I think I need to know what prudence means. I don't know what you'd disapprove of me saying. I feel as though the door is closing. I don't want it to, and when I thought of it, tears came silently.

I feel no desire to stuff you in a cage, to smother you with blankets, to cause you to change your plans. I only want to continue, to allow the stream to carry us further. I want to know if "prudence" means that there are things I can no longer say, or if it instead alludes to an area as yet untrespassed.

Quiet in my room. Working on the last assignment for this class, mind feels dusty. I want to start the next class tomorrow. Trying to finish reading PAC because I want to be able to talk about it with you. Still really want to hear about your theory of serotonin and dopamine in conjunction with PAC. lol look at me, "conjunction." It's rubbing off. I described something as "disjunctive" earlier today. New words, I can't help it. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I recognize the states in your description. "Oceanic feeling," what I call new eyes. I'm interested to see how it plays out. I knew a kid with actual low-functioning autism, completely nonverbal. He would sit doing the same stuff for hours, but was also a little volatile, emotionally. Tantrums if he was disrupted. Wonder about that. Serotonin reminds me of engagement, focus, but not necessarily calm or happy. Idk. I should get back to the schoolwork.

weir 21-Sep-20 05:45 AM
Atom bombs and geopolitical tensions, this last assignment isn't so bad. The material is crap but it makes me think of things.
Which of course isn't conducive to actually finishing the assignment. I'll go back to it in a minute. But first a funny story.
In the UK, there was this terrorist, Guy Fawkes. You probably know of him. He was a catholic, and part of a plot to blow up the houses of parliament. Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated every November 5th, also called Bonfire Night. Children make (or used to, according to my mom) little effigies of the Guy, before gleefully setting him alight. There's a poem about him.
Remember, remember, the fifth of November with Gunpowder, Treason and Plot I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
Anyway, it's one of the few tangible links to her English culture that my mom was able to share with us kids. We always celebrate it a little, sometimes a fire, sometimes not. Mushy peas on a few occasions, with vinegar.
and then it was funny, my mom was talking to her mom, my Nana about it. Before she died. They were on the phone, and my mom asked if they were going to celebrate it, and Nana sorta went "No-o.." and apparently she thinks we're related somehow, and doesn't approve of the effigy burnings. Made me laugh.
thought. she thought. Oh well, back to the cold war. Nearly done now, a few more paragraphs.

Late and I'm going to sleep but first I wanted to tell you that when I was reading PAC yesterday (I'm only like 60% through) I was thinking about how it could apply to thought, to cognitive models held by evolved biological entities and I wrote some little note about the invariance assumption and what I called the "New Room protocol" which I think might just be the same thing as what you're talking about, with the serotonin etc but inferred from a different angle, from the evolutionary (?) benefit presented by it. Basically, when the environment changes so dramatically that your model isn't accurately predicting the data it makes sense, ie there would be a survival benefit to the existence of a hardwired protocol (instinct) among adaptive organisms faced with high-threat environment changes, an instinct that would cause a shift to a new testing period, a new model allowed to form. If it simply updated the old one you'd have too much conflicting information, I think, for effective action. But if it changes to be a new model, one that you currently inhabit, the old one can exist unchanged, in case the environment ever starts to fit the old one again, you can go back to it. Typing this on my phone and I'm kinda fried, been a long day, but hopefully you get something out of it.

But it constrains me nonetheless. And I want it to, I can't not.
Serious, I am serious. Because I do love you. And and I want to be yours in the way that I can be.

that's all I needed to know, really
see,
loyalty misplaced
was something I was afraid of
and now
loyal in a certain way
bound to you, and I want you to know it
I don't need you to promise me things, a future together or something like that.
It's like my head tries to explain reasons for things that my heart's doing and it makes a mess of it sometimes.
I like being yours, in the way that I have been. I like to care for you, to write to you. To trust you. I want you to make me crumble, uncomfortable, break the walls.
I think I would be lying if I said a part of me doesn't think that distantly, very distantly, meeting you is a possibility. But it isn't something I need. What I need, and I do need it, is for you to touch me.
to offer you an immediacy I cannot manifest is not my intention, would only be a cruelty. What I offer is the knowledge that I'm not going anywhere. I promised you honesty, and some of the things you should then know about me are these
I am loyal in love, obsessively. And I love you, I think completely. I have no desire to look elsewhere, for more suitable men, as you've put it.
I am not ready, not positioned right within the world to be someones serious something. So I hope you let me be your playful one instead, at this distance, when you want me.
that is all for now, I think

Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 10:45 AM
that's why I didn't want to tell you
because it was something which could only be known through action, not words
I still would like to know myself
I like it when you are hesitant, draw back at my confessions. clinical.
because it shows that you care for the truth of it and not the illusion
And I'm scared of the illusion. Still very afraid of it, to fall prey to it.
I think that's part of what makes you fit, why I allow you close. Because you're content, or at least strong enough, to maintain a distance.

If you think I mean emotionally, don't be distant, I would never ask you to.
What I mean is that if you were asking me to settle down or even if I sensed that you were the type I would probably rebuff you cruelly, as a kindness. Because I am not ready, not positioned right within the world for such a thing.

We have a set of variables that can be true or false
There is a conjunction of literals (e.g. v1 AND v2 AND NOT v3) that we need to learn, it's hidden
We get to see valuations, that is, sets of True/False assignments for each variable. And then for each such set/valuation we get to know if the hidden conjunction is true or not given these values
Let me know if that's clear
I will add a concrete example.

There are three variables, v1, v2 and v3
They are like states of the world at a certain moment
or features
Right now, I'm thinking of a conjunction and you have to guess it.
We can drop v3. There's just v1 and v2
When both are false, the conjunction is also false.
When only v1 is true, the conjunction is still false.

But even in this first one. It could be that both the positive labels were just flipped randomly
that those two people actually didn't get hired
There's <0.1*0.1 chance of it, less than 1%, but still we can't know

You should show me that some time
This is the last example of this kind
This is where we see, I think, that we can't figure it out by force, and we need to use a more quantitive method
Maybe you can find it, but I don't think so. The labels flipped in such a way that no certain pattern remains

1 1 1 seems to predominate, but only slightly

it seems to favor second value 0

The true hypothesis was actually that the second value must be one.

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:37 PM
We are looking for literals (v1, not v1, etc) that contradict any given hypothesis
This is something that is really slippery in the mind
First, the difference between variables, which are the features of each applicant
and literals, claims about those features, the building blocks of the conjunction we want to find
Is that difference clear, or slippery for you as well
I wrote it pretty abstractly. I can do better

weir 21-Sep-20 02:39 PM
it's still unclear
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:40 PM
This is very helpful. My mind refuses to work on it because too many concepts are up in the air. This way I get to anchor them, make them clearer
Ok
There are the variables, the set of yes-no questions that are asked about each person
And each person is defined by an answer to each question, a value for each variable
Then there is our language for articulating demands
It contains two words for each variable
A demand for it to be true, and a demand for it to be false
The words in our demand language are called 'literals'
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:42 PM
ok
looking for literals which contradict the hypothesis
this is where I'm stuck
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:42 PM
Yeah that part was very unclearly expressed
I'll do that over again
We are going to consider one literal at a time. So maybe first we consider v1, then v2, then 'not v1' and finally 'not v2'
And for each of them we want to know how likely it is that it's in the conjunction, the criteria for the job
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:45 PM
look to see a pattern in what is true, and then from the other side, a pattern in the false.
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:45 PM
Yes. And what makes it harder is that there could also be no preference on a variable
There could be no demand for it and also no demand for it not to be true
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:45 PM
right, it might be irrelevant
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:45 PM
Yeah
So, we start with v1
What pattern do you expect to see if v1 is part of the conjunction
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:46 PM
a solid one, high proportion of either true or false
if there isn't a 90% level pattern, you're looking at v1 being irrelevant probably
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:47 PM
We should split the applicants into two groups, those who got hired and those who didn't
If everyone who got hired has it, but almost everyone else does too, we can't say much
right?
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:48 PM
yeah
true
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:48 PM
So we calculate the percentage of people who have v1 (whether hired or not)
We call it q0
Then we calculate the percentage among those who did get hired. We call it q01.
Now q01/q0 gives us the "hazard ratio" for getting hired if you have v1
that is, if v1 is twice as common among hired than others then q01/q0 = 2
Stop me if you want to repeat anything or go deeper
To be more concrete
50% of people have v1. But only 25% of those who got hired have it. So q01/q0 for v1 is 0.5
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 02:51 PM
yeah ok
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 02:51 PM
That example is unlikely actually
Unless the sample is small
If we look at a very large sample, the difference will grow bigger and bigger if 'not v1' is in fact in the conjunction
and so q01/q0 will approach zero. Because those who have the 'hired' label can only have v1 due to the random flipping
while those who don't get hired can have it as much as they want
Let's make it more concrete
v1 is having a criminal record
and this is a job for a kindergarten
So actually no one gets hired who has a criminal record, but there's 10% noise in our data because of bureaucracy mixing up some files
This is probably demanding to follow. I will try to rethink a different angle
Or get to the point

Don't worry, my mind is spaghetti too
This is sortof like your dishes
But it's something I try to overcome because I think it's important. I think I can learn so much from this degree
I mean, it looks too easy to bother thinking about until it's too hard and I give up
But yeah
Given a literal like v1, we want its frequency among hireds to differ as much as possible from non-hireds
The problem is, if the v1 is part of the conjunction, e.g. is required for the job
An applicant could still be rejected for missing other qualifications
So out of all the people who have v1, a large number will still not get the job, even if v1 is one requirement
So that's a weak signal
It's easier to look for things they must NOT have
if 'not v1' is a requirement, there will be almost no hireds with v1
only the <10% due to noise

bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:07 PM
Another metaphor might be more apt now
Literals as drugs, treatments
Instead of hired/not hired, we have symptoms/no symptoms
of some disease
So v1 is a drug
If v1 effectively treats the disease, only very few people who take it should still have the disease
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 03:09 PM
so that would be v1=true
that scenario
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:10 PM
The conjunction would include 'not v1' I guess
and among examples where v1=true, they are almost always labeled false (not sick)
The conjunction is like the conditions required by the body to produce this sickness

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:12 PM
Trying to compare those who take various drugs
There are two different drugs, we have people taking one, both or none
To see if either of them either causes or prevents the disease
v1 v2 not v1 not v2 [1. , 0.75 , 0.66666667, 0.75 ]
The numbers are q01/q0. So people who take v1 are exactly as likely to be sick as anyone else
This is weird

Here's a main thing that keeps slipping from me
and I think I might have even explained q0 and q01 entirely wrong, not even sure
I'll just do it over again
hopefully correctly
We are looking for the probability of a given literal 'contradicting' an example
We start with the first literal, 'v1'
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 03:22 PM
v1
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:23 PM
For it to 'contradict' an example, the example would need to have v1=false
but for 'not v1' the example would need to have v1=true
so if a literal is a treatment, the presence or absence of a drug
I guess what trips me up
is that we consider first 'v1' and then 'not v1' totally separately
and contradiction means the opposite, in terms of what is required of an example
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 03:25 PM

would a visual representation help somehow
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:26 PM
I think what you said earlier is a good hint and I had a similar thought
It means something if the value is very high or very low
Right, that's it
So first we consider v1, then v2
We are looking for low values
then we consider not v1 and finally not v2
on paper, we still look for low values
but this is how we check for suspiciously high values of what's being negated
I think?

weir 21-Sep-20 03:27 PM
right
that makes sense, although I'm leaping
it isn't reasoned
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:28 PM
me too
Let's generate another example
q0 then q01 v1 v2 not v1 not v2 (array([6, 6, 4, 4]), array([0, 2, 4, 2]),
what stands out most is that zero
to reiterate. The first row is how many times each occured in general
the second row is how many times each occured in an example labeled true (got hired)
no, it's how often each was contradicted, ingeneral and among winners
Maybe it's actually meaninglessly complicated.
Something about it makes it very hard to grasp and hold
But yeah, first row is how often each literal was contradicted
second row, how often contradicted in a winner example
I feel ready to attack this now. So I think I'll try

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 03:45 PM
Here's an overview of the algorithm
1. Calculate apr(z) = q01(z)/q0(z)
2. n1 = q_/k
3. Create a set I containing all literals z such that q0(z)/k >= [here is an expression. Can leave out for now]
4. n2 = min{apr(z): z in I}
i.e. n2 is the lowest apr for a literal included in I
then n_ is min{n1, n2}
min is 'take the smallest of'
Then finally, we take the literals in I where apr(z) is smaller than an expression based on n_

A conjunction is coded as a string of 0s and 1s, it has two halves
[v1 and not v3] is [1 0 0 0 0 1]
The first half has 1s for ones you need, 0s for ones you don't need
The second half has 0s for ones you CAN have, 1s for ones you can't have
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 04:34 PM

bjorn96 21-Sep-20 04:35 PM
so 1 0 0 shows that there's a center on the left that must be filled with a 1
and 0 0 1 shows us that the first and second are open, but the last is blocked by wall
Are you familiar with binary operations like 'or'?

Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 04:36 PM

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 04:37 PM
So if we or together the first half (1s you need) and the second half (0s you can have)
the 0s are all the optional places. All the variety among examples that satisfy the conjunction will be on these 0s.
So for [v1 and not v3] = [100 001]
100 or 001 = 101. So only the middle one is optional.
The first is present in all acceptable examples, the last in none.
So then we know there are only two different acceptable strings. That's just a neat thing.
Not that relevant. I'll go on to the more relevant stuff.

If v1 is the only one that is always 1 and all examples are positive...
Well, the empty conjunction is still a better candidate in that case
The hypothesis that 'you don't need anything, just make all examples true'
is a better hypothesis than 'this thing that is always true is causing it'
So I think it's correct that if a variable is always true or false it's not useful

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 04:51 PM
I hadn't before held in mind the following ideas: The possibility of necessity. The possibility of impossibility.
That's the core problem I think
First we check the positive literals, v1, v2 and v3. But since we are open to all possible conjunctions
we don't know which one yet
v1 v2 v3 represent the possibility of necessity
When looking at v1, we are asking, is it possible that this one is necessary?
Then, at 'not v1', we ask, is it possible that this one is impossible?
Avatar
weir 21-Sep-20 04:53 PM
you look from the other side to see impossibility
Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 04:53 PM
Yeah
We can't show certainty, necessity, because of the noise. But we can falsify within a probability
We can say, if v1 is necessary, the probability of seeing this is extremely low
If v1 is impossible, the probability of seeing this is extremely low
Actually it's not a new idea to me at all, funny, but I totally didn't find it

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 04:57 PM
p-values are used a lot in studies
It's like, those who took the drug performed x much better than placebo. The probability of seeing a difference this big due to random chance is 0.1 / 10%
in that case they can't conclude anything
because the effect is relatively likely to happen now and then just due to random chance
due to there always being differences
but if it's really low. If p=0.01. It means, by taking two random groups and testing both, you'll only get this kind of difference once in a hundred tries
Then they can say, ok, this could still be chance, but it's so unlikely now we'll conclude it was our treatment that did it

Avatar
bjorn96 21-Sep-20 05:01 PM
If the conjunction is actually empty. Making absolutely no demands
then the probability of an example being negative is equal to the noise rate, 0.1
So if there are 10 examples where v1 is positive. And all those examples turn out to be negative.
We might suspect that 'not v1' is in the conjunction
But we can calculate the exact probability of this happening for an empty conjugation
it's 0.1 to the power of 10
So that's extremely low and we would actually assume that not v1 is in the conjunction

finally done with the assignment
window open because the air is good
I can hear cars drifting across the soundscape sorta
and there's a homeless guy yelling, hoarse, cussing someone out
this happens at least once a week
I don't know if he keeps meeting and arguing with the same person in the same spot, or if the other person is a particularly menacing lamppost or what
I feel like he probably yells at everyone he sees, and sometimes he's also within earshot of my window when this is happening
the game I mentioned, it's called Mastermind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)
Mastermind (board game)
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back ...

NICE it went through quickly this time, the assignment. I'm gonna sleep soon.
oh, something funny from the assignment. They had this picture. It's a dummy at a nuclear survival test site, back in the old days. Famous photo, very cool looking, like the blast blew it over like that, he's barely standing. I reverse-searched it, there were some other cool photos.

including this one

And I might be totally wrong here but I'm pretty sure that's the same pair of mannequins, the guy in the suit, the girl in the dress. The same cars even.
And I think they rearranged them for a more dramatic picture lol
so I thought that was pretty funny
but they're still cool pictures
also love how it's all horribly apocalyptic, bleak looking, but that's just what Nevada always looks like.
anyway, I'm going I think
oh wait, this one is cool too

the visions
so last night, after I finished my assignment, I was happy, hyper. I decided to read a little, wear yellow glasses and wait for sleep to kick in. Too many days of odd sleep.
anyway, I was catching up on a few things, reading. Remember that I kept finding things interesting, noticing that they were connected to other things I'd been thinking about. Maybe it was only superficial.
I don't remember the specifics, but I was brushing my teeth, thinking about something (I think it was PAC-related?) and how it was the same thing as something else, only built differently.
but the imaginative
I was reading this paper you'd sent, back when the air was still really bad. I'd read about half of it and hadn't finished.
Anyway, I was reading it, and I noticed that I was kind of wandering, had more imaginative lure and stability than I usually do. Odd images.

The second 'law' of thermodynamics claims that all order dissipates, that the universe can only ever closer to a total blur and average
And the doctrine of biology is exactly the opposite, that all complex forms must be explained by pointing to simpler forms that combine into the more complex
You can attribute it to the sun unwinding
But still, these two notions are very unclear and there are apparently good criticisms
The notion that simpler structures are metaphysically more acceptable as preceding causes
and that the whole universe must necessarily behave like small approximately closed systems

some sort of underlying order to the universe, right
I remember thinking that it was the same thing as what I call "what works" which is an underwhelming name
but basically the principle that there are certain laws, ways that things fall
and when given enough time, they continue to fall in those ways
building into something more complex
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 02:18 PM
not a bad name, in physics they talk about "things that can do work" and this is one way to measure information
yeah
Analytical minds are comforted when a complex thing resembles the combination of several simpler things
But to assume that simpler things come first is a bias I think. And then there's the problem of the ontological status of "ways things fall" and "complex forms", or "emergent properties" as theyre often called
It seems they must exist in some way prior to being manifested
So I've been drawn to a dualist metaphysics where both unformed energy and pure form or information are primordial

In physics it's called entropy and negentropy. The loss of information through homogenization and the creation of information by creating distinctions.
But it's paradoxical because of multi level effects
If you have no distinctions, everything is different and also the same
Once you make a distinction, you can separate things so that each half is relatively homogenous
So there's more macro difference but micro homogeneity
What we mean by laws may not fall completely aligned to these two terms
I'm thinking
Because both are sortof laws
But two types of laws
So creating regularities, is to make things different

and as far as I can tell, the complex things outweigh the smaller parts. the contractive, creative force is greater than the entropic, dissolving one.
and also they work together
the entropic breaking apart structures that are complex, technically
but very stable
no longer growing
and then they break into chunks
and when they reform
they reform into something different
even more complex than before

Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 02:36 PM
So we have two principles. What gives shape and what is given shape
The latter we can think of either as a passive substance to be formed, energy. Or a force, dissolving order, entropy
It is the opposite of distinction and so it is 'one thing'.
The opposite principle, that gives form, or is form itself
It is distinction, it is and knows about difference
and so different forms relate to each other as strangers, as non-self
unlike entropy, energy which is all indistinct
So once the formgiving principle has established a certain form, which by the definition of form is stable, crystal-like
This form, the son of both principles, becomes the enemy of what created it
Because this formful stability prevents the creation of new forms
At the same time, it is at odds with the entropic force that always resists such order
But the form is essentially a way of channeling energy into a circuit that maintains, so that attempts to break down effectively become a force of conservation
And so the ones that are no longer growing, though a product of form imposed on energy, it is now an obstacle to both forces that created it
Small adjustment haha
haven't thought of this in a while
But that's what I belive

Anything too poor in either principle is invisible, barely real
Like air and gases are somehow not as real as liquid
Solids intuitively feel most real, perhaps
but they can't maintain themselves
Life emerges somewhere between liquid and solid
with pockets of gas
Pure energy would not even be electrons and protons
It's something even more homogenized
No gradients whatsoever
Pure nauseating movement

Avatar

Yeah, that's a beautiful description of life

if this metaphysics is true, then it seems that natural history is the advance of the formgiving principle and slow retreat, though constant resistance of the entropic principle

Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 02:46 PM
They can't not smuggle it in, but they sweep it under the rug
"emergent properties"
this is a major issue I have with math
A function is a mapping from one set to another
And that's a model for anything, the universe, time
A set of all possible states of the universe
and a function that takes an input state and gives an output state
That function is time
But what's interesting is what's inside the function
Which stops being itself the moment it is captured in a way that persists
Then it's no longer becoming, once it's recognized
Recognition makes it a regularity
The function itself, before it is described, is 'what works', it's the Chinese dao
which means 'road' or 'way', and it's said that the dao you can give a name is not the dao
Or a more direct translation, the dao that has a name, is not dao for long
not a long-lasting dao
The very act of naming, the doctrine that there are 'things' that exist across moments
That are 'the same'
Is foreign to it

bjorn96 22-Sep-20 03:05 PM
I'll check in now and then
I'll be back fully later
I wanted to add one thing
In my image there were two primary distinctions, a 2 by 2 matrix
active vs passive
and organizing vs decaying/disrupting
Here we see a universal feature of this kind of analysis
It's always on the terms of the organizing principle, which acknowledges distinction
and 'things'
So 'the thing that is given form' is an oxymoron
It's not a thing until it has form
But we only know things that have form
Things without form are impossible to predict, are defined by us not being able to predict them
so we call it something like tragedy, irreducible error
noise
meaningless pain with no recourse
but a close approximation is to say that it's a "thing" that is "given form"
The truth is, form appears out of nothing
and when we look at the parts that make up the form
they are only recognizable as distinct parts due to internal form
and further, all the way down
When all the form is unwinded, untangled
what you have left is absolutely nothing, except vague pain, your organism failing to sustain itself, possibly
mind itself untangling too
Anyway, it's just the point of the dao
And the point I made before, that in every dichotomy
one half consists of the things that fit the dichotomy
the other part of the dichotomy consists of things that don't
I want to go into mathematics and computation with this mindset
looking for deep regularities and meta-regular insights
I want to rely on immediate evidence
rather than reports of others
I have disavowed neuroscience to an extent and I stand by that. It's a short-cut, but has no explanatory power. We need to find mathematical/computational/semantic/philosophical structures that are immediately obviously true
But I still read neuroscience as a compulsion
and I recommend you look into the various rhythms
Gamma waves, Beta waves and theta waves in particular
Gamma waves are extremely close to the notion of "wider connections"

According to the thousand brains theory, the cortex is made up of functional units called columns
Each creates a complete model of the world, the slice of input it gets to know about
They group together, not sure if they think like this or if this is my observation/hypothesis
They dynamically form coalitions
Gamma waves is the mechanism for this, or a symptom of it
Probably a cause of it, actually
It causes larger coherent coalitions of columns and neurons to agree, to represent the same kinds of things
Or more complex, unified concepts and objects

Reply when it's convenient, I'm a bit hyper

When a greater number of neurons or columns cooperate to form a representational coalition, single objects become more detailed
points become more specific, more accurate
things are more firmly and confidently located in the space of associations

I want a deeper, more human and more timeless theory of which the culture wars can be a petty special case
One thing I think is true, is that societies and organizations are biological phenomena
as such they exhibit biological behaviors
and the diversity anti-race drive is a nation state exhibiting homeostasis
Because ethnic sentiment in a racially diverse country is a serious threat in the long term
to the health of the state organism

I don't know much about the inner workings of it, but I suspect two causes
Financial class wanting to weaken the working class
and priesthood/cultural class wanting to signal to their peers
and a third cause
mass motherhood hysteria, obsession with "goodness" and soft values, as a kind of overcompensation for personal and existential deficits in left-wing voters (including many men)
not only motherhood deficits, also heroism deficits I guess

weir 22-Sep-20 06:04 PM

I think there's mass dissatisfaction with men among women
Because civilization drives forth a kind of serotonergic office man who the economic market selects for, but who is deeply unheroic and therefore can only win in the sexual market by leveraging his economic success
Economic often is mostly about achieving a certain status, respectability
not that the money itself is so tempting
This also creates a class of men who fail in the former system
Avatar
weir 22-Sep-20 06:08 PM
status yeah, I notice that
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 06:09 PM
The former kind of man believes in 'goodness' and is completely cut off from his deeper nature
But the latter kind will have various problematic tendencies, violence, psychopathy, sanguinity. Because his failure in the economic-status system is so absolute, there are no moderating forces on these tendencies, in fact they are encouraged, because this is his sole advantage over the opposite kind of man.
And so women come to the conclusion that there are only psychopaths and cowards
And become lesbian feminists
Both as a practical solution, and as a provocation
attempting to trigger a reaction from the masculine force that is absent in functional form
SOmething like that

I found him on twitter, but he was a smaller account then. Still big, think he was just shy of 20k.
He's got a small handful of accounts he promotes, who promote him
I think I found someone that I thought was funny, and they were following one of those etc
It's interesting to see the social structure that surrounds big accounts and their smaller counterparts, friends I guess.
Miya has that going on too
I guess the size of the account is somewhat irrelevant here, it's more the level of general charisma

I think those people dropped off eventually, but it boosted the numbers for long enough that the account drew attention from other followers, more interested in the content. right. I'll tell you
someone, I think it might have been weeb. weeb was involved anyway.
uh, someone set up an egirl tourney using twitter polls
so egirls and their simps everywhere
were suddenly competing, crossing over circles colliding, orbits.
but the whole point of the tournament was to expose the Miya account
it was a setup, they had all this drama pre-planned
at the time Miya was posing as an actual egirl
and then they leaked some tranny
panty bulge
said "Miya's fake, Miya's a tranny"
and then I think they got weeb to accuse Miya of grooming
and there was this whole backdrop of salty, catty egirls

of course, the widespread attention was just a step, what came next was content, good content drawing the kind of people they were looking for, not just the initial gossip-surge

specific signals to display
recognition granted to higher status members

weir 22-Sep-20 06:59 PM
here's something I've been thinking of for a while. It isn't done yet, it's tentative, but it's relevant to what we were just talking about, social drama, network effects. Hopefully I don't mangle it too much. Hierarchy, basically human social structures are centered around it. there are several aspects to hierarchy, layers which I haven't fully peeled yet, so it's messy.
for example, there is earned status within the hierarchy, that's a constant. Universally among all humans, there are these constants at a broad level: 1 there is a hierarchy 2 one's place within the hierarchy changes over time
but then you have layers of 1, these layers vary
different contexts appear, there are hierarchies within hierarchies
I think I'm legitimately too tired for this lol
I'll just try to sum the main point instead of presenting the layers, the details.
because humans naturally create +/- relations, hierarchies form. Because these are often built upon character attributes and reinforced by social opinion, the hierarchies then tend to be pretty obvious, stable. By this I mean that agreement is reached within the group about the social status of each other member of the group. This agreement is more visible, strong, regarding the "upper" members of the group, the leadership. Roles vary within the social group, there are several high positions, including being feared and obeyed, being liked, being notorious.
so any time you have a group of humans in social relation to each other, whether that is classmates, a sports team, co-workers or families, they form a hierarchy, reinforced and agreed upon across the group and modern people are almost always part of many of these groups at any one time, and can hold different roles within different groups
governments, large governments are formed on the basis of the natural instinct for hierarchy, and I think it's closely tied with religion. God-emperors. But it's not enough. You need something to hold people together, so what you get in successful large societies (corporations, nations, kingdoms, armies, churches) are a series of smaller hierarchies that eventually rest upon the individual units of the society.
pyramidal
which means that decisions, signals, made near the top float down, ripple out to massive effect
so if the CEO of Disney, which controls like a 6th of media output or something like that, suddenly, on a whim decides "the color orange is ugly, we aren't gonna use it anymore,"
it's massive, suddenly TV, books, suddenly there's no orange in this huge slice of them.
or if the Pope makes a decision which is then implemented by the various levels of church hierarchy, it eventually reaches the little church near you, you're at the level of individual units, not just being impacted by, but actively working to manifest this change
as if it were their tribal leader someone local who told them with great urgency to do something, they do it without question, to a large extent
although there's grumbling
but usually it is someone local who told them
the top of their pyramid, the preacher
but the preacher got told by the guy at the top of his pyramid
so people form these machines, and there's a control center near the top, and it decides what the machine will do, to a very large extent, a broad extent. Other areas take care of the details. And these machines, these giant robots, they exist throughout history, held together by religion and military conquest and human nature. Led by kings and popes and rebellious heroes and all sorts, really. But they had always been SLOW before. limited.
it took a long time to send a signal
it took a long time to receive feedback about how effective it had been.
and it isn't like that anymore, it isn't slow, the links are better. The robots are faster now.
And it allows them to be bigger as well.
anyway, I'll stop

The hierarchy is an important structure
A hierarchy is a network with directed arrows and no tangling
If A points to B and B points to C, C is not allowed to point to A
So it's a network with properties that makes it easy to think about, because every trajectory is finite
You sometimes see hierarchies morph into a more general kind of network and vice versa
When there's a schism
for example
It's not surprising that hierarchies are such powerful models. Being a special case of networks.
The network is the most general model available to thought.

bjorn96 22-Sep-20 07:34 PM
Each social group starts out as a non-hierarchical network
but hierarchies emerge
it stratifies, rationalizes the connections
Nature is solving an information flow optimization problem, almost
You get what's called a "small world" network
Where each node is connected to every other node within a small number of connections, but at the same time, most nodes have few connections
This is the optimal network organization for information flow, it balances conservation/differentiation and efficiency
Its achieved by the creation of "hubs"
clusters
Clusters or subnetworks organize around their hub, a node that is connected to distant nodes, often distant hubs of other subnetworks
That way, most nodes can just be connected to their local hub and a few peers
yet they're two connections away from a distant subnetwork
When this happens on several levels you get a pure hierarchy
Social networks, brain networks, even matter

Why are they so powerful
and other question, are there other formalisms I've overlooked?
Maybe I have to think about language more
I think it essentially operates on a network though
Avatar
weir 22-Sep-20 07:46 PM
a word isn't the thing, this is true in the literal sense, obviously. but in the abstract sense, a name isn't a definition and I think that matters somehow
a definition is more limited than the name
it's a description of the impression of the whole
a name evokes the whole

I think there's a kind of recovery muscle
or not muscle, bad metaphor
there's like a recovery force you build up by being surprised, going different places, doing totally different things, etc
meeting different people, following different stories
etc
and lying down like that is how the recovery force gets spent

bjorn96 22-Sep-20 08:51 PM
put the finger on the spot, a single finger. Feel the finger with the muscle, with your back
Narrow the sensation in your back to a small specific point under the finger
It might be hard to localize your muscle attention in the back that closely
let me know if it\s easy or not
Avatar
weir 22-Sep-20 08:53 PM
it's different
sort of like going numb
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 08:54 PM
yeah that's the sensation I expect
there's a very rough neural representation of this field in most people because it's not used for fine grained stuff
and that's arguably why it gets tense, cause there's no simple way to top-down command it
So it's on its own and just goes by the general state of the body
You can learn to feel it narrowly and specifically, like a finger
Give me feedback whenever you feel something or have a thought
Avatar
weir 22-Sep-20 08:56 PM
that's a really cool explanation
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 08:57 PM
Hopefully this can benefit you
So to increase precision or resolution of the neural control
The first thing is to learn to cause contraction exactly at this spot
with minimal or no contraction around it
We learn to relax it only by learning to conscously tense it with very high specificity
So the finger is important, the sensory
*sensor
But when the muscle feels numb like this, it's hard to do that
If you try, I suspect there will be some larger movement nearby
in roughly the same direction as what you wanted, but not exactly this tight spot
You can try

weir 22-Sep-20 08:59 PM

I can but it's still tied to other movements
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 09:02 PM
Imagine your finger gently drilling into the muscle. Not in a violent way, applying minimal, but significant pressure
a spiral motion
the finger doesn't really move,
at least not more than miniscule feeling out
but the finger tip searches for a way to get into the hard muscle, the spot where the muscle will yield
Avatar
weir 22-Sep-20 09:04 PM
I think it helps
Avatar
bjorn96 22-Sep-20 09:05 PM
The spot is like maelstrom pulling the finger in
sortof expanding like a tunnel too
the finger sinks into it
And the deeper muscles under the surface one, they also come into play
You can also try to tense, as if to push the finger out
tensing a small an area as possible, exactly at the finger tip
you can search with attention for the right spot, you'll feel a kind of pull
even if it's very vague at first
at some point the muscle mass starts melting around the finger
and soft pillows come out, inflating
that were hard, constantly tense fibers before

Another thing that can be important is to find "cracks"
Where the muscles attaches typically
or a place where two muscles meet
I'm not even sure what it is, but it feels like a crack
Like a tiny crack where the muscle will eventually yield to a soft but insistant finger
splitting apart, puffing up

I just woke up, and it's 4:28 am, I'll probably go back to sleep for a few more hours til it's light. But I wanted to leave you things I guess. Not sure what yet, but something.
Goats are jealous. Jealous, and they enjoy attention, they like to be scratched and petted. Ours would give birth in the spring, a month apart sometimes more. And I'd always have favorites among the new babies for a while. Sit them on my lap and pet them.
And then at one point, I remember that one of the babies got too old, too big, so I stopped doing that, switched to one of the smaller, younger goats.
Well, the first goat didn't like that. Came over to where I was sitting and absolutely walloped the little goat lol.
I'd experiment to see how they'd react to things, the goats. Once I went into the pasture and they were busy, didn't care. So I tried ignoring the whole herd and just petting this one goat really intensely. The others got jealous and all came over, the ones with a lot of authority shoving the other out of the way so they could be petted instead.
They didn't like novel things, not at all. Once I got a pretty pink bandana, and I tied it around the neck of one of the yearlings, just to be cute for a minute, like a picture of a golden retriever puppy. It decided to rejoin the others and they all saw that it had a bandanna on its neck and RAN away really fast. The yearling of course ran after them, unsure of what dangerous thing was surely right behind it. I had to chase them down and take off my bandana, then they were all fine.
Our goat dog tried too hard to be a goat sometimes. We'd throw tree trimmings into the pasture for the goats, and the goats would all fight over their portion. Stupid dog would get a little branch for herself and pretend to eat it, not like a dog would, by chewing on the branch, but mimicking the goats, lips peeled back trying to chew leaves. If a dog can grimace, she was. Goats would come and try to eat it and she'd warn them off, keep trying to eat it. Never swallowed any leaves, but she bravely chewed, gagging a little I think.
Goats like to climb trees, jump up on things, especially babies. I used to sit in the oak to read and the babies would come up into the tree to pester me. Wasn't paying enough attention and one (her name was Jet) bit a little corner out of the page I was trying to read. I'll never know what those three words were lol.
They also like to chew on things, rub on things, although they're picky about what they eat. I had one that LOVED rubbing her head on my boots for some reason. They like rubber and leather, will also go after leather gloves, tires etc.
enough about goats lol
Sitting here and the dark is wrapped around me gently. Headache is gone now. Quiet outside, although I heard the train whistle as I was waking. I love the way it drifts through the night to get here, echoing, a drawn-out howl.
Sometimes they load or unload lumber at night, and I can hear it from all the way across the city. Huge booming sounds, tons of logs and rough lumber being dropped onto rusty metal. I think it's that, anyway. We have a lot of timber around here, sawmills throughout the city, logging operations nearby. Trains come and go with wooden things.

One more story before I go sleep. This one's kinda funny, but it might be a bad thing, I don't know. As a kid, I climbed trees a lot, usually fairly small ones, fruit trees being the most interesting, obviously. My dad, he's always trying to predict and avoid disaster, tell us not to run downhill, noticing cups too close to the edge of the table, adjusting them so they wouldn't be knocked off easily. The small trees, he didn't mind much, and I only fell down once, out of the walnut, a dead branch. But then I got older, adventurous. I got myself a rope, and I started climbing really big oaks that were on out property, old ones. My dad was worried, I was up pretty high, fifteen, twenty feet maybe. I remember him telling me that if I was going to climb trees that high I needed to wear a helmet, and I told him that if I fell from that height I would just be dead and the helmet wasn't gonna help anything. He wasn't happy about that line of reasoning. I think I was only ten, eleven at most, stubborn, stupid. Anyway, he did make it a rule that I had to wear a helmet, which I found to be so annoying that I didn't climb the tree anymore, probably for the better.

bjorn96 23-Sep-20 01:57 PM
For some reason I especially love your stories today. The goats terrified of the bandana, the one wearing it also getting scared. The dog pretending, out if all things to be a goat, pretending to chew, like a kid smoking but not inhaling. And I love trains and lumber.
Today is so ridiculous
There's this class I've been completely neglecting. Only attended the first lecture, have occasionally checked for assignments but haven't been any. Got up super late, very lazily checking websites and contemplating some deep lack of motivation and turns out there's an exam that started literally minutes ago and I have two hours. I download the test pdf feel deeply offended, reality & society has no respect for my sensitivity, gonna crush me with these ridiculous demands. Get my shit together, don't know any of the algorithms they ask about but they're pretty easy. Did everything except one problem. I think I'll get a decent grade.

weir 23-Sep-20 02:43 PM
I slept in and the sun is up now so I'm yawning, but the headache is gone, I feel better. I think I'm going to get started on the new class, figure out the plan of attack. Always varies, the strategy for each class is different. Sometimes you HAVE to read the whole textbook, other times the textbook is so bad that the supporting professors have just made their own materials and you use those instead, are informed not to look at the text under any circumstances. It's funny, this school opposing forces. There are the people who design the class, write the textbook etc, and their job is to make it seem like it's rigorous and important material, they'll make it sound so hard, pad the textbook with extra shit, useless stuff. And then there are the supporting professors, the ones who actually try to get students through the class, answer questions. And it's their job to make the path through material as easy and direct as possible, because it most of the time it pretty much hinges on one exam, on the final, so it doesn't matter if you do little practice problems, drills in the book don't count toward passing. "don't read chapter 7, it isn't on the test" lol. So the approach to each class is different, but only unofficially, they can't admit to it openly. Takes about an hour to extract the right path to completion from supporting materials and the testimony of other students etc. So I'm going to do that, find the right approach. This one seems to have some actual content, might need to read the textbook, idk. For the easier ones, the concept-based classes, I usually don't need a page-long explanation of the concept, those ones I'll just read the first chapter and the glossary, attempt the practice test. But there hasn't been a stupid-easy one like that for a while, probably because in more advanced classes.

We underestimate randomness. Since an early age I've repeated the platitude that 'free will' at best can be thought of as randomness and as such is something meaningless. The opposite is true.
Randomness, not imposing control and prediction is to leave a canvas for the sum of all forces outside you
And the miracle is that when this is done at a large enough scale, some kind of unmistakable will imposes itself on this canvas of randomness
PAC formalizes this
Randomness is Chaos
A more specific, more prosaic word for Chaos
In any endeavor, whether it's building a home, a society, riding a bike, writing a poem, there are two kinds of Chaos
THere's the Chaos we embrace, let inside, whose tension with us is a gift
This is the "approximate" part
Demanding less exactness is to allow more intimate chaos
Intimate chaos, small chaos
The more small chaos we accept living with, the smaller the probability that big Chaos will burst through our walls
It's as if small chaos exerts an opposing pressure on the inside of our walls, preventing them from imploding
Big chaos is Probably
small chaos is approximately
Stiff things accept no small chaos, they must be exact
And so they break
While bendable things allow a lot of small chaos, thus it's much harder for them to break, big Chaos is kept at bay

It's like small chaos in the form of jokes etc kinda prepares you for medium chaos

this can be good, I think. Maybe.
Avatar
bjorn96 23-Sep-20 06:52 PM
small chaos has two mechanisms of ameliorating the unbearable presence of big Chaos
First, it turns some regions of big Chaos into familiar space
You learn to master it, or not be knocked down by it
The other mechanism is as a warning, so you can avoid it
What can be good
Big Chaos?
Avatar
weir 23-Sep-20 06:53 PM
the branch breaking, I guess. A dead branch is rigid, will break eventually. So if chaos is destructive enough, breaks the branch, maybe it was better that way.
Avatar
bjorn96 23-Sep-20 06:53 PM
If you zoom out and look at the bigger system that the individual thing is part of
then what is big chaos to the part is small chaos to the whole
A person dying is unbearable to them, their close ones
but to the wider community it's a ritual that renews life
also across timescales
what is unbearable, big in a certain moment or period serves, in a bigger timeframe, as a warning, a preparation, a renewal

not all
but for example
theta tends to organize, syncronize either alpha or gamma
so there's a big cycle supervising, forcing into place, one of two alternative subcycle systems

a day split into hours, or split into quarter hours

bjorn96 23-Sep-20 06:59 PM
and in both cases the third level is minutes,seconds
I wanted to suggest a riddle, or story to you. It's a starting point for exploration
You are a spirit, and the physical system serving as your body has very limited expression. Maybe you're a mass of snow on a mountain. You sense your environment in detail, the weather, life moving around you, but you have only one action. With enough concentration, you can detach yourself, disintegrate and collapse down the mountain as an avalanche. You stop existing. Your action is limited to selecting the right moment.
Or you could exist in some electrical circuit powering a light bulb or some other machinery. There's a lot of randomness in when you short-circuit, this is the range of your action. You can speed up or delay this event. Again, you have massive sensory inputs
So a single action, but many sensations
And what you must do is learn your own significance
What does your one action mean?
To you it's just effort, unclear
What it means is defined by downstream spirits and matter
Who feed their chatter back to you
through your senses
This is the situation of a nerve cell
They can't decode what most neurons "mean"
because it's unclear
They must learn their own significance
And act as best they can, as meanigfully as they can
given only a single action
and imperfect beliefs about its own significance to its downstream neurons
That's the "riddle"
I just feel like important things are built into it
Avatar
weir 23-Sep-20 07:05 PM
thinking about it
but that'll take a while, I guess
meaning is a funny thing
because it's hardwired, it differs in different organisms
not sure I can imagine it at a really basic level yet. My framework might be wrong for that
Avatar
bjorn96 23-Sep-20 07:09 PM
Let me know if you have ideas, whenever
I mostly wanted to formulate it
What's different about a neuron from a whole animal is that the neurons existence depends almost entirely on communication
Even motorneurons. The energy they feed into muscle is not for directly moving the muscle
Instead, it just acts as a switch
a signal, causing energy from nearby repositories to create the actual movement
So neurons are mostly detached from dealing directly with nature
making things happen etc
They live entirely symbolic lives
and so a neuron's existence depends on understanding its significance
I think in our time, this is also a human condition, at least to a large extent
Some people do jobs directly interfacing with nature
But modernity is a process by which most of us have significance entirely as symbols in other minds
And our success depends on understanding this significance, or at least acting in congruence with it

Just, another thing I thought about
To create any kind of language or code or representation
It's important to give short symbols to things that are either common or urgent
And things that are rare or non-urgent can be given longer codes
You can see it in natural languages, and this is how zip works
If there's a 10-letter sequence that occurs very often, you can strategically encode it as a single letter
massively reduce size, and you can restore it
you just have to spend a little space encoding the meaning
And this is also clear in our conceptual system
So the philosophy and metaphysics of a time will always be formulated in metaphors employing the most commonly used systems in everyday experience
Or what's experienced as most urgent
It has been computers, internet for a while now
The universe is information
And then it becomes clear that we don't get to the bottom of things
We just find faster ways to say more, to people who know similar things to us
And occasionally, that way, we say things we didn't expect, that turn out to be true
And that's an insight, a revolution, but it's still just efficient encoding of a ruthless stream of opaque experiences, we can never look behind them
Avatar
weir 23-Sep-20 07:21 PM
the universe is information, thinking about that
humans, what it means to be human
it's constrained, and it can't not be
it's supposed to be I guess. the limits are what give the shape.
I was thinking about it yesterday, about values. About how you can judge others based on your values, right.
and there's universal things, but they don't matter by themselves
by this I mean that if you're a dog and you're judging another dog
all the dogs have universal traits in different measures
so hounds are really good at smelling
and the hound might look down on the labrador for being bad at smelling, because the hound values smelling
and humans do that sort of thing too
values are very internal things
anyway

bjorn96 23-Sep-20 07:25 PM
Universal things don't matter by themselves

bjorn96 23-Sep-20 07:26 PM
And a distinction is negative, it's to rule something out
But first, something unreflecting must create a set of options
in the idealized form, two options
Two possibilities
And then a mind distinguishes by ruling one out
Two ways to not exist
To really not exist, or to exist as potential, be ruled out

I think exactly the same
I wasn't sure if you would agree with the binary

But all distinctions are binary
Complex distinctions are made from many binaries

Each grid cell fires at the edges of a hexagonal grid
There are many many such cells, each with its own phase (e.g. slightly more to the left, other displacement, but same size and rotation)
or its own rotation
or its own scale
If you just know that one grid cell fired
You could be anywhere, in the large scale
But you must be on one of these spots
But if you combine multiple, it narrows it down
This is an efficient way to encode a space with only yes-no questions
Ever played the game where you find out what the other is thinking about by asking yes-no questions?

Now, the problem the brain is solving is
How to segment all of experience into a minimal number of yes-no questions
So that a minimal number of yes-no questions can uniquely (or uniquely enough) identify each distinct 'thing'
If each cell meant only one thing
You would need one cell for every thing
And all cells would be quiet almost always
Not feisible
So once a cell has acquired a single meaning, it can segment out the times when this meaning is useful, plausible to downstream neurons
and times when it would be ignored, because it's impossible due to the context
Then it can mean something totally different in the down-time, when it's first meaning is precluded
Other neurons learn to interpret it, "it's this context and it's firing, so that must mean this"
That's why each neuron fires to a wide variety of stimuli
The grid pattern is a visual form of this
There is a certain distance at which the probability is sufficiently low of the animal being in the first spot encoded
and then, even if it fires, the surrounding cells will not believe it is there, because it's too far away
and now it can mean something else
its meaning arises in cooperation with the listeners
Just like the same word can mean different things in different contexts

bjorn96 23-Sep-20 07:44 PM
And this is how everything breaks down to binary distinctions
And how as much meaning as possible is outsourced to non-physical "pure" information
"This signal can only mean x in context y and so..."
Can't formulate this properly
But the neurons use natural laws of information to encode as much as possible with as little as possible
That's why computers use so much more energy than brains, doing so much less

Avatar
bjorn96 23-Sep-20 07:48 PM
Yeah that's interesting
The context precludes it, so it can mean something else, but in this case it transcends that
by signifying its own meaning in the other context
and the tension is exhilarating
It makes you slightly unsure what situation you are in
You're in a safe situation, but some random event sortof resembles a dangerous or more urgent, or more significant situation
and someone does something to push this similarity further
an action that makes sense in that more tense situation that is incidentally evoked, but doesn't make sense in the actual situation
So there's a flicker, for a moment you're unsure, and it causes this pleasant (or unpleasant if taken over the edge) metabolic surge
I guess the pleasantness is the conscious realization that you won't have to spend lots of energy, after quicky, automatically, unconsciously accepting that you're gonna have to spend a lot of energy now
So one way people can joke is by pretending to get really mad, start a conflict
And then you realize they're joking, and there's a realization that the amount of energy, tension, effect you'll need is way lower than you just now prepared yourself for
You think so?

weir 23-Sep-20 07:52 PM
I'm not sure if it's that, though it's an interesting thought
certain phrases, or even social moods indicate a different situation
so like, each situation is an environment, a landscape
and your job is to move across the landscape
you have to cross obstacles
and a joke like that, a statement that evokes a different landscape, it's layered
because sometimes it draws an actual parallel to that other landscape
and sometimes it shows how false that is somehow, like, it's a trigger not for that landscape directly, but for the next step, the next thing you think of after that landscape

but the point is, I guess is that it's layered. because it's true, I used to bully him a little when we were kids, but it's also not true, irrelevant because I'm not going to do it now. And then because of the contradiction, it brings other concepts to mind, the "next step"

Haunted house, my mom took me to one the halloween when I was ten maybe. Dark and crowded, lots of people being shoved through the corridor, "monsters" raeching out as if to touch you, bad plastic masks and fake rubber hands pawing at you halfheartedly. I wasn't scared by it at all in the "scary predator" sense, dark and mountain lions were real, this wasn't even close. But I saw people in masks, and it made me uncomfortable to have to interact with them, I knew I was supposed to act scared and I couldn't muster it. It was extremely threatening in a social sense, very awkward. Laughed uncontrollably the entire way through.

I think smell in general has this property

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 02:21 PM
especially seeing how you interpret it is important to me
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 02:25 PM
so basically, in any given situation, (entity + environment) there are a series of "next steps" available, within reach. Accessible. And then, the next steps, the mutations or happy accidents or whatever, the environment dictates which of these is useful. And it does it all the time, for all of them at once. Building, because once a step has been taken, it impacts everything else, now there are new steps accessible.
an important part of this seems to be the idea that environment dictates direction, it might be "big chaos," he calls it serendipitous
"punctuated equilibrium" of evolution
sometimes the environment changes really drastically, and that's when there is suddenly a huge uptick in new targets
so you get a lot of rapid change to adapt to this
and in different directions you might not have otherwise had
6.3 is does evolution have a target and 6.4 is achievable target pursuit I thought these were particularly relevant sections
he did note that a major limitation of evolution in comparison to machine learning is that evolution can't update assumptions in response to feedback the way an algorithm does, it relies upon successful reproduction, it's a little blind in this way, monodirectional
gonna read the rest of the chapter. I want to be sure I understand it. It makes sense, I just want a really really good grasp before I start playing with it too much.

Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 02:43 PM
no, in a very limited sense
like an algorithm gets input, something happens
it knows
it can change the algorithm right there, right then
very flexible, it impacts everything immediately
whereas negative feedback (or positive) occurring in the case of a single entity
fawn gets hit by a car bc headlights are shiny
that takes time to spread to the population
even if it's obvious to the algorithm, I guess
or if cats develop an ability to eat fruit
would be super helpful
but you still have to wait a long time for it to spread genetically
can't just be like, "okay all cats can do this now"
and that's all I mean
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 02:48 PM
Yes, I understand that. And this is the standard view. That organisms are shaped only through individual level selection events, differential reproduction among individuals, capped by death
Let me put it this way
Every algorithm, every calculation, takes advantage of some non-physical prior, some logical set of assumptions. The fact that arithmetic works is because of some deep correspondence that goes beyond any particular case
So it's not our positive, physical symbols, or explanations that make addition and multiplication correspond to each other, there is some logical correspondence we can't fully name, because we can't imagine the alternative to it
And I think in the case of evolution, there are probably some important computational or formal principles that play a major role, and that, if discovered and understood, would make the physical process of selection seem subordinate, just a means to an end
It's not a well articulated view
But it's an intuition many people have had

weir 24-Sep-20 02:53 PM
but the individual steps taken, these are individual, slow, death+reproduction so I did phrase it wrong
because evolution updates assumptions just fine
the hidden logic
but it still takes time for the population to catch up to the hidden logic, the target (s)
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 02:54 PM
Thinking about the distinction
I understand what you're saying
To clarify my view a little, another analogy
If a chess player is told a sequence of moves, he imagines the game and can choose among a limited number of options. It's very meaningful to him, because the options are highly constrained
To someone who doesn't play chess, or someone who doesn't even speak the language, or some creature who cannot speak at all, the moves being described are less meaningful, because the frame of possible interpretations expands to include all possible meanings.
And so I think we know some of the major "moves" that evolution makes, natural and sexual selection
but we don't know the relationship between genes and phenotype except some hints we get from observation at a high level
It's difficult to explain
Evolution is searching a space that is much more constrained than we think
constrained in such a way that massive inferences can be made
And the gene to organism pathway probably takes full advantage of this
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 03:01 PM
I do think there's something big out of sight, and I think the book even touches on it lightly.
although one way to look at it is that "the ideal function is a set of functions" or, that during the process of natural selection, it is never selecting for just one target
always selecting for the best combination of accessible targets

like do genes kinda contain "new rooms" of their own? I don't know much about this though.

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 03:05 PM
I think the partial answer is, very few genes are expressed at any time, in any cell
new rooms
tell me about that idea
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 03:06 PM
ok
came up with it while I was thinking about how animals could use PAC-style learning
so if PAC is predicated upon two basic requirements
invariance assumption
and learnable regularity
then the invariance assumption is super important, in order to have a functioning model
and a functioning model, a representation of the landscape is necessary to move successfully in the landscape
so if you're an entity with a lot of agency, like a human or even a dog or something
and the landscape changes drastically, you have the opportunity to react to that
but it requires you build a lot of new assumptions really quickly with minimal interference from the old model
so you start lower down, closer to the beginning, it's a new room. the old model is discarded
I can give an example if you want
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 03:11 PM
That is lucid and meaningful
New room
And yeah, genes must take into account a very large number of rooms
Anything that survives today has lived through all the geological phases since the origin of life
So it must have an efficient mechanism for transforming itself into different shapes that are adaptive under the various environments that occur on earth
You would think

The key question is, what is the memory capacity of evolution?
And I guess what I'm arguing is that it's a lot bigger than people generally assume
That we didn't evolve for "the jungle"
We evolved for the sum of all geological epochs and their subdivisions since the origin of life
And our dna is probably optimized for multi-generational manouvers, like turning into some earlier form if the environment changes

thinking about a lot of things
suddenly, mitochondrial dna
and also how genes can get stuck accidentally, uh, imprecise. A big chunk can break off, misreplicate somehow.
and types of chimerism
anyway, I don't know enough about this area to be useful
genetics, don't know much about the science of it
but one of the cool things about the PAC theory is that it's so widely applicable, so I can think about it in a behavioral context
and then to an extent I can carry those ideas over to other contexts I guess
sometimes
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 03:22 PM
The ideas go very deep
The invariance assumption, I think is most generally the assumption that the future is like the past
Which of course is a basic assumption for knowledge and informed action
Training data is just a technical word for the past of an algorithm
and test data is future
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 03:23 PM

behaviorally, which is guided by instinct obviously, but probably largely shaped by PAC learning you can look at animals seasonality, expectations

too cold
so that's a "room" a model of what's outside: snow, and what it thinks about that: too cold
but later, it's spring and there are birds and stuff
no more snow
outside is ok again

animals have to learn very quickly in order to escape them
like, there's a goat right now, rescued
she has burns
because animals take time to learn, I guess
kids will touch the hot stove
goats will apparently walk through fire, even if there was likely a better alternative
in order to have a model with a lot of stability, an idea of the environment that works, it has to sort of withstand irregularities
aggregate them
so when confronted with a drastic change
you need to form a new model basically
and you can't let it impact the old one either
idk, that's what I was thinkinh

Most genes are "non-coding", some go as far as calling it "junk dna". What it really means is that they code for something abstract
Exact same in neuroscience. A few neurons can be tied to specific visual shapes and colors etc, but most seem to not "mean" one concrete thing
There are two questions that always must be answered. What room is this? and then what to do in here?
In some rooms there's only one thing to do. In other rooms, what you do is really important and requires lots of perception and planning

They are identity
they are only like themselves
Of course, when we grow up and see a lot of faces we don't care as much about, they become different
We can take a more analytical approach
But still, they have this whole identity quality
A face IS a person, a soul almost
In Russian, the word for face is the same as for person, personhood

y += 1 (add 1 to y)

A class is like a blueprint
and then you can make as many objects of that class as you want
a class contains variables
so like
class Point:
x = 0
y = 0
Now I've made a blueprint for the class of objects called Point
Each Point object I make will start out with x=0 and y =0
but then for each point I can update these two vars, without affecting other objects

we make a Point class. So now we have a class of objects, but no actual objects yet
Then we make the first object, of the Point class. point1
Then we do the thing we're not sure the significance of, making a new variable and setting = point1
This could mean "make a new Point just like point1"
but we want to verify that it means "let mystery_variable be another access point to the same object that point1 accesses"
So then we change the x property through the mystery_variable access point
and check if the x of point1 is what was changed, and it was
the 10 underneath the frame is the output of the last line

So it's as I said, but numbers are conceptualized different than I thought
x = 1 does not mean to create a Number object whose value can be changed
it means "x is now a name for the universal and unchangable object 1"
and so x+= 1 does not mean "change the value of this number" it means "x no longer is the name of 1, it's the name of 2 now"

you had to pass through a very narrow horizontal opening

it either has no internal subdivision or it has no location relative to other things
like a "place", a room.
That sounds wrong of course
When we are going from one room to another it's clear that the room has location relative to other rooms
But at that point it's not a "room" anymore, not a whole
When we are doing things in a place
There's a frame that is a background, that everything is anchored to
a horizon or outer fence of our representations

weir 24-Sep-20 04:21 PM

there's always the explicit stuff at the center, then a half-visible implicit frame it happens in. But then there's the stuff beyond that doesn't even come into play, that is blocked out
I think the "room" is the implicit and explicit, that is bounded by this kind of awareness horizon
And rooms are built around this aspect of our minds

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 06:52 PM
you're totally right
the signifier, the thing to be explained, the sensory is external. Making it consistent and predictable. It's external.
Ultimate significance is something completely subjective, an action, life or death
and that's internal
But that means I have to change some ideas
Cognition becomes mostly an expansion of sensation
When I talk about this thing I seek, or feel I have too little of
I sometimes describe it as sensory but that's wrong
It's not a lack of sensation, it's an inability of the sensation to penetrate deeper into emotion-action
Cognition can come from inside too I guess, when you start by asking what you want
rather than what exists
Very useful
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 06:55 PM
the internal, that's the other source of information
and you're constrained by both
moved by both in different ways
it's a war, a dance
the internal, that's where values occur, judgements of things, proximity to something is desirable, something is desirable
it's the cause for movement
it's the reason for anything, otherwise you would be useless, not a you at all

Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 07:08 PM
okay, so there are two basic inputs, very basic. Sensory/external stuff which tells us what the world is, what it's like.
and then instincts, very very basic ones, which tells us what that means
so we touch something sharp
and our finger say's "sharp!"
and our instincts go, "sharp is bad"
very basic
there is this tension then, and massive amounts of data at all times
and it's important to keep in mind here that a lot of ideas, abstractions, are kinda sensory in a way, external not instinctive
so you've got different parts of the brain trying to deal with this data
forming two pictures of the world, overlaying
and then you have a landscape that you can actually move within
whereas with only instinct, you just have movement, purely reactive
and with the analytical part, you just have a picture of the landscape, and it's got no reason to move, it's cold
agh

same half, different angles of relation
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:13 PM
yeah
One weird thing
I'll call them action and perception, the two halves
One weird thing is that the action half is associated with impulsivity
like you use the word instinct, and it has this impatient connotation
while perception is associated with patience and long-term planning
But then, there are two basic strategies. To start with what's possible at the moment, or to start with what you want in the end
And this dichotomy is at odds
I want to clarify the distinction, give it a proper name
I guess attack and defense
Defense is when something is too urgent to ignore
Attack is when you can proactively find a goal
It's a somewhat messy territory
what is their relation to perception and action

Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 07:24 PM
so the gas pedal and the destination, but no idea of how to actually get there
and sometimes the parent decides that the destination should be something else
and this can work short-term while they still have inertia
so you can say, I'm gonna do this homework
while you still have inertia
but eventually the little kid realizes that the destination is wrong, not where they want to go
and they refuse to press the gas pedal
grind to a halt
I basically wrote this about "mother and father" a while back but it's so tangled
what I think I'm trying to point out is that society, it burdens you with an idea of a destination
and you're supposed to take up that burden

yeah
the expectations of the social game we play
suggests a certain life path to take
like I "should" go to college and not like, join the foreign legion or go live in the sewers or whatever
humans come preprogrammed with social expectations I guess. The desire to serve the group, or the family, or something like that. Prosocial. That's part of it, but not all. Culture suggests rules to follow, that's literally it's purpose. But sometimes the rules aren't good. The wrong illusion, different destinations in mind.
Like my dad, he wants everything to be safe, that's his top priority. Where, I want it to be GOOD and I'll risk a lot for that.

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:32 PM

a negative one

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:34 PM
in the kid analogy, a bad parent will sometimes reward a child for complaining or crying or whatever
I think the basic distinction is pursuit vs avoidance
first there's action/emotion vs perception/cognition
then within action/emotion
we got avoidance/pursuit
I mean avoidance vs pursuit

Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:38 PM
Apparently animals will freeze as long as they think escape is impossible, to play dead or not be detected
so that's accepting the inevitability of the current situation

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:39 PM
You can do it as pursuit
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 07:39 PM
there's immediate pursuit and there's grim pursuit
the emotion part understands immediate pursuit and is pleased by it
the grim pursuit is part of a plan, and the emotion part will only be pleased by it if it trusts the plan, and likes the plan's destination
so if you're really obsessed with say, hockey, and you go run every day, that's grim pursuit you're doing it because you want a distant benefit and believe that it will help you achieve an even more distant destination, which you really, really want
but just playing hockey, that's immediate pursuit, very fun
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:43 PM
Grim pursuit I think is where cognition/perception has a long-term prediction of a desirable outcome, which it can activate,simulate whenever emotion/action wants to quit, allowing habit to run in-between those confrontations
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 07:44 PM
yes, but it has to be an actually desirable outcome
that's probably what "inspiration" is, a really important goal, dream, plan.
I hate to do anything as a form of avoidance
Avatar
bjorn96 24-Sep-20 07:45 PM
I think the parent child metaphor is really useful
The suffering of doing avoidance is caused by the hope that you might not have to do it
isn't it
as soon as that's completley quenched, it's not painful anymore
can even develop into pursuit
Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 07:47 PM
yeah, if I get started on homework I'd been ignoring then it can even be fun

The two kinds of Nothing is important here
Nothing can be its own kind of substance. The image that's conjured up when saying Nothing.
In this case it is defined in contrast to other plausible things that could be in the same place, or play the same role
Or Nothing can be absolute, which cannot be named
And correspondingly, two kinds of Being
Being something, in contrast to something else. Being "different from something"
Like 1 is defined as being different from 0
Or Being at all, being "different from Nothing" in both senses
Do you understand what I mean?

The Nothing that you imagine, it maintains the most formal features of its alternatives. That is, it's an empty region in space. It still has extension, boundaries, potential for being filled. It is different from everything that could occupy this space.

The Nothing you can't imagine is an absense of form and substance both. It is different from Nothing, because it has no features to compare to other things.

but back to the question
p looks at the world and finds the consistency, forms an accurate, true representation
and the e judges that
like, judges everything within it
and also, something important I think, e is tied to action

weir 24-Sep-20 08:17 PM
yes, that sounds right
then instinct is the internal reacting to something sensory, and that's kind of one of the building blocks of emotion
that's what values form from

you get an involuntary sensory response to that

bjorn96 24-Sep-20 08:20 PM

Avatar
weir 24-Sep-20 08:20 PM
I meant will, innate basic judgement, unreflected
that's what the emotion/action matrix is built out of
because emotion/action it's a model too
so when you perceive, that's involuntary at first, but then you are driven to make sense of it
to make sure it's consistent, to understand why it works, how
maybe reverse the order of that
to understand why it works, how and you know you've built an accurate model when it's consistent with incoming data
predictive
does that half makes sense to you?
If it does I'll try for the emotional.

I was looking at some of my old photos of autumn to see if they matched your color scheme, and some of them did. There's this thing in early autumn where the leaves turn orange and yellow and green, murky, not yet the really vibrant red and gold hue, or the late-season brown. And in autumn, the sun is at a different angle, light isn't as harsh, you get different types of photos, less bright, saturated. I doubt the photos contain the emotional quality at all, think it's just reminiscent of the color scheme. Emotion dependent on context, content maybe? I don't know. Here are a few examples.

colors are mixing and someone desaturated in those two

weir 25-Sep-20 04:39 PM
somewhat I don't know why I wrote someone desaturated
But I came to leave a thought, small, about "chaos"
And how there can be two general dimensions to the word, although it comes also in volume.
First type of chaos is something we don't or can't understand rationally, it means we don't see patterns.
And then I thought about how Eliade uses it, and that might be a different, a second type, I'm not sure though.
Outside the walls of the city is chaos.
But not necessarily rational chaos, the outside is likely understood. But it's like, emotional chaos, values chaos.
Probably nothing, just a little thought.

How was highschool for you? How did you get through it, did you have plans? I never went, so it's hard to see it clearly. I want to help him to care about it enough to do the work, but I've always been dismissive of the importance of public school, perhaps that's bad, maybe I'm a bad influence.

I think your attitude is a prerequisite, because presumably he feels the same way, at least instinctively. So only someone who shares the outlook could sympathize. I will tell you
I found the whole social environment completely foreign and saw myself being fake. And I perceived adult life, "real life" as being embedded within this foreign and completely repulsive world. The only thing I cared about was getting away from that. I wanted to quit several times. I quit before the last year. Retook the missing classes, you can pay to just take the exam without schooling.
I found the actual curriculum laughable
It was so obvious that no one cared about learning anything, except in an extremely shallow way
Either to pass the test, or to satisfy the teacher, depending on the type of person
I can't really offer any advice
What helped me care
Was actually dropping out, saying fuck it, I'm not going to do this, and then looking at a situation where nothing is holding me back and I have to contend with the fact that it's really difficult to make things happen
And was convinced that there are good people doing good stuff, and if I pursue something in university it can be worthwhile. And forcing myself to learn the discipline of these institutions can be useful for my own projects.

The best I can think of is, he has to ask himself what he actually wants
but then that's not easy either
and when I ask myself what drives me, there are times when it's very altruistic, when I come up with very responsible sounding philosophy to justify my goals, but maybe it's really just that I dislike most people very much
I am infatuated with the vertical space between me and others
I don't know what would drive him

weir 25-Sep-20 05:18 PM
It's valuable to hear your perspective, experience.
I'm not sure either
that's kind of the big question
video games became his teenage passion and I feel as though that supplanted some sort of important exploration
where you look at the world and go, "most of this sucks" but then you find the things you really like, are interested in
but as an aside, it's really nice to hear about your life, it's familiar.
except I want horizontal space
want to leave, get out, go live in the country. As a sort of stepping stone, I think.
anyway, I'll try to help him. thank you for answering my question.

teenage culture and video games is so dysfunctional
and I think humans don't have any inate long-term morality map. We only respond emotionally, motivationally to small moments, compressed images. Long-term behavior must be insulated by habit or society, in essentially negative ways, through punishment or making it effortful to deviate.
There might be more physiological long-term maps, states of the body tracking how you're doing
but they're not very good at staking out a course and maintaining it

culture, society. It's something external that you need in order to move as you're supposed to, an exo-something.
but most culture and society is garbage
right now, I mean.
it doesn't tie directly to people, it's wrong I think. A part that doesn't fit.
maybe it's a dead branch, or maybe it's just something big and distant and you're trying to force it to do the job of something else, more local.
in a general sense
I need to make a world, I think. Find or make. In order to move as I should, and by this I mean just basic function, my human programming.

Some things fill me with contempt
middle aged couples where the woman talks about the man as if he's a child, or always with a little bit of irony. And men like my high school teachers
In the first case it's not towards the woman as much as the couple as a whole
or even the man, primarily
you had your whole life
and this is what you create?
Perhaps it's not easy, but if you can't do better than this, there is no hope
that's what I might think, not so much now

One of the things that helped me was my Nana.
She came to stay with us for a month
and she was fat an old, and a little silly, very spiritual (although this might have been why)
but she still had wonder
she loved the world like she was a little kid, she loved trees and she'd take off her shoes to walk in the grass
she didn't raise my mom, they didn't see each other for years, it's sad. but she was an example of an old person that hadn't lost whatever it is that people lose.
of course, later I wondered
if maybe the particularly stupid kids I had met
would simply become this type of adult, the horrible ones
I still don't know. It must somehow be a matter of perspective, they can't see their lives as horrible. That might be the problem, actually. Somehow they are content with something wrong, and I can't stand it.

Sleeping soon, today I finished PAC. I'll tell you more later, but in general it felt like it was missing something important. Obviously not my area, I'm not sure of this. He's discussing algorithms, proposing limits to computations etc and they make sense, very powerful. Good at sorting data. Good at representing some sort of base code of universal happenings. But missing pieces. It's practical, useful, clear. But I think there's a lot about biological learning/thinking that I think wasn't considered in depth, some statements I feel iffy about. It isn't a picture of how the mind works (not that it's supposed to be) but when it wanders into that sort of territory I feel that it's overextending. That said, full of very interesting concepts that I want to explore further and learn more about, and the overall theory is extremely coherent and relevant in its limited sense. Limited but broadly applicable, I know that's unclear. Hope you get what I mean, too tired to do better.
Avatar
weir 28-Sep-20 06:16 AM
Towards the end he's got this section on robust logic, it's supposed to address brittleness etc. And one of the examples is a function where on the right-hand side is a word like peanuts and on the left is a continuously adapting (learning) list of concepts relating to the thing on the right, of everything that can be linked to that, kinda. "all that matters is function F be from a learnable class C" and it does address brittleness, it's great, really, an excellent solution. But I don't think it's an analog to thought, to how humans or animals think and make associations. I feel like it's inefficient somehow, clumsy, and there's a better way it could be done. I want to know if you can get these things to think in terms of, idk, spatial relations and not words, words, words. Can the matrix be (a representation of) an actual dimensional matrix illustrating connections between concepts, things? I'm tired and feel like I'm either saying really stupid shit or really obvious shit, and there's a good chance that I misunderstood key concepts within the book. Don't mean to sound quite so critical, the good parts of the book are really good, I just get stuck on the bits I don't get or don't like, I guess. I should sleep, I'm gonna sleep.

bjorn96 28-Sep-20 08:06 AM
I completely agree with your assessment of PAC. I feel this way whenever a computer or math person talks about thought.
These people are almost completely unaware of how their own minds work. They're the kind of person who will unironically claim to not be conscious, that consciousness is an illusion, not even interpreting that in any subtle way.
But I'm glad you also see the value in it. Computational theory is important and any attempt at humanities in the 21st century is irrelevant unless it contends with computation.

My brother, he's in his last year of highschool. And our area is extremely political I guess, I don't know the extent it's a nationwide phenomenon, but most people here are agents of social justice first, and job description second. Or it's in the job description lol, often is with education, I think. Anyway, he's suffering that in his English class, and I had the same experience with the local college so we were able to bond over that, and then later he got excited about "the future of mankind." I'm gonna take him on walks every day now at lunch, get him out of the house. He's usually not talkative at all, so it made me really happy to get more of a glimpse into what he cares about.
He mentioned Elon Musk several times in different contexts, and I remembered that at one point he was interested in electric cars, making better batteries etc. Wondering if I can encourage him to explore that area somehow, maybe send him articles on that sort of thing until something sticks.

The freeway is rushing, and the rest of the city, arterial streets intersecting a mile or so away. I can pick out individual cars. Construction nearby, yellow metal emitting sine waves. I hear a passing train, and a songbird. There's fog above the soccer field, soon massive flocks of Canada Geese will descend, stay here all winter, shitting. Someone left offerings at the foot of the trees, a soda cup by the apple, tipped over, dew collected on it. It looks refreshing, ready for bigscreen debut. At the foot of the plum tree is an N95, yellow straps grimy and broken. I didn't see it at first, obscured by twigs and spiderwebs and some long grass. The air is good, cold and clean. I'm going to put the phone away and keep walking.

and I think about envisioning a series of causal links, and it's kind of like animal training to me
you start with an animal doing certain things and you're trying to build a behavior
and you can't go straight to it, you have to build, distort slightly. A series of distortions that don't make sense immediately but lead to the larger behavior eventually

there's trajectories, and there's the part-whole way of thinking
each object is a reference frame

I'll tell you about the past few days I guess
my brother told me his friend want's to bring humanity to space, and I told him I want to bring humanity to humanity. thinking about that a lot, about meaning
missing meaning in people's lives, I guess. it disrupts the patterns. I mean, it's caused by the disruption.
it seems like such a little thing, social bonds. But it matters a lot to the beastie, and that's what everything else is built upon.
It seems that that's the big thing that's missing from civilized society. Fixing it in my own life is some sort of logical attempt at doing the "right thing," reasoned out. But then if I think about it too much in that way I feel sick, it disgusts me.
It's a tangled area, very internal, attempting to apply theory to it is easy but it isn't nice, it's like splitting the skin to look at the tendons.
I get the same disgusted feeling when I try to apply anything but theory to the world at large. I don't like the sentiments about "helping people" in a vague sense. Like teachers and nurses are "helping people" helping society or the planet or something. To me the wide world is the right place for theory, and the little sphere around you is where you apply emotion, I guess. React. An old lady at the store accidentally knocks over a box of food, and there are things rolling everywhere. So I go help, I fix it for her. She's too old to bend over and grab all the things. I can care about that, I do care about it.
But my prosocial radius is small, I try to keep it small.
because if it stretches too far it becomes utterly irrelevant
so I help old ladies and stray cats, anything right in front of me, but I refuse to get emotionally involved about a hurricane in Florida, or an explosion that killed people. That's the right place for theory.
Which usually works for me, but then I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do, and I'm using theory. And it's insightful, but it hurts a little, feels wrong.
That's the great strength of religion, I think. It allows for inspection in this abstract way, kinda like theory, but it places you firmly in this insulated moral landscape.
So any ideas I get from the cold pursuit have to be translated into something like that to become palatable, in order to be useful to other people.
I think I want to try making movies, or film at least. Someday, I love the medium. But it doesn't seem like it's enough, it's an aside, something nice.

but it's a beautiful medium, combining visuals and sound
It's funny because I grew up without it, almost entirely. Can count maybe five movies I'd seen before the age of fourteen.
But my dad was always warning me "don't go into the film industry"
because I have an aunt who did and didn't "make it"
But later I got to watch some movies, and thought it was really cool, liked the way it was done. Wanted to make music videos too, maybe. A lot of space for meaning.
Families used to cluster around the TV every evening, and I like to think of it as an LED analog to the hearth.

you have a kind of parental concern for people, you pity them as they watch TV all day. To me this seems so futile. Should we try to convince them that their life is mundane, that this is a bad thing, then offer them some completely new lifestyle derived from theory? Perhaps this is the peak of their ability.
and feelings about the adequacy of a whole societal system preceding the level of personal mastery that would render all such theory obsolete, through the sheer attractive force of example
to me it just feels like the wrong place to look

weir 28-Sep-20 05:34 PM
I think people need a nudge. I could be wrong. I think they'll find it anyway, regardless of me. But I'm not so worried about the large scale here, it's difficult to care for it.
Talking about society reinforcing
I mean for me, I mean in my life, the lives of people around me. In really tangible, accessible ways. Not ones that currently exist for me, but ones that could exist.
The ways that people are moved, tend to move in relation to social situations, I'm saying completely coldly without a "this is good" that it exists as "positive" too, reinforcement.
That's actually something really central to what I want to achieve by "finding the others." I feel that a shared moral vision allows for people to work towards something. In a fractured way that can then come together later. Just at a very broad scale, it's a theory. I don't feel emotionally attached to this idea.
My little brother, he's trying to get through school because "society" will punish him if he doesn't.
But say he's got a dream, a big dream that he wants to pursue. Like, making better electric cars for example.
I can reinforce that. I can say, "yeah, that's a good and important thing"
I guess that's what I mean. I think you might be jumping to conclusions about how I feel about people in general. I don't have a plan for them.
I like film because it's nice, it's pretty. I enjoy it, I think if I made things that I like, some other people would too. I'm not sure why that matters to me but it does in a way.
I don't want to puppeteer the world. I think I might have wanted that once, when I was a teen it seemed briefly to be one solution. But I don't now. It's beyond me. I want to understand the world, but I don't have a plan beyond that. How can I?
How can I have a plan for something I can't even see?
The world is intrinsically interesting to me, I like to inspect the way people move. I want to be wary of it, and I think it's cool.
It isn't some top-down plan for how I'm gonna brainwash everyone.

I think that "modern society" in the sense of an implicit values-system that can be passed among individuals or transmitted from central locations is something unnaturally large that is preying upon an instinct for small-scale social cohesion, resulting in perversity and unhappiness.
I think the wide solution to this isn't to change the giant thing, to change the amalgam of noise and intentions resulting in "modern society." I think it might simply be to fulfill the need for small-scale social attachments in a way that isn't currently offered to most.
I think religion used to do this, I think people used to go to church and hang out with their neighbors, and this filled the small-scale need, so when they saw stuff on TV it wasn't such a big deal, somehow. They knew what their place in the world was.
It seems to me that many modern people are so detached that you get mass hysteria over stuff that absolutely won't impact them whatsoever, and they meanwhile ignore meaningful connections to their local community, to their family.
This is pretty much what I think, my view of a mismatch. It isn't a proposed solution, and I don't feel strongly about it.

When I turn the theory on myself, I'm applying a formula, something so universal it can apply to anyone, just fill in the blanks. It's very reductionistic, and it doesn't allow for nuance. In addition, I think it's strict in that it's a facsimile of the way people generally move, it isn't a full understanding, and therefore it is unforgiving, not articulated, not easy to change. It could even be wrong, large sections of it probably are.

weir 28-Sep-20 06:12 PM
Wrong theory, wrong application of it.
I do need social connections, but the primary point of them for me cannot simply be "social connection."
although I still feel like some people do need "social connections" in that way
My mom makes friends with everyone, indiscriminately, and then discovers them to be something that she finds annoying, and discards them.
She gets a lot out of meeting people for the first few times, I guess. But then she realizes that she's interfacing with someone who maybe doesn't share her values at all.
leads to a kind of teeter totter of judgement, her opinion of a person goes up and down really wildly,
but beside the point I suppose
I really suffer with something, and that's basically that I have instincts, values, and they're supposed to guide me through "the world," but then that doesn't work out right, because "the world" is different than what my instincts are coded for. So I come up with theory, a sensible way to move through "the world" in a way that avoids the rough areas, then hopefully get me to a better place where I can go back to instincts.
And I dislike explaining it, because it seems like it's hard to differentiate between the two, when talking to other people. The theory doesn't always seem nice to the values. It's especially hard with social things. If I explain stuff like diet, it isn't emotionally charged. Yeah, I instinctively like potato chips, but I have a theory that limits my consumption of them. Same thing as what I try to do in relation to "society."
Avatar
bjorn96 28-Sep-20 06:35 PM
we have instincts that are supposed to guide us through the world, but the world doesn't match the instincts. Theory can help us out of this, so we can go back to those instincts. (edited)

The world is bad, it wasn't supposed to change. The instincts are bad, they were supposed to guide us, they're not as bad as the world, but they broke our trust. In both cases, the analytical self (calling itself 'theory') blames some innate deficiency in the other, rather than enter into a deeper relationship with instincts, the world
And the end goal is a return to a past world, without uncertainty, a retreat
'Instincts' can be really crude when treated impatiently, superficially, e.g. potato chips
but when a harmonious and living relationship is established with them, they are both broader and more far-sighted than theory, theory then becomes a skeleton for it, or a midwife
And the world
This world, 'society', potato chips and TV, is the apex, the head of the human projectile through history, think of what a remarkable canvas it is
the number of people, the amount of time and freedom given
but a small inconvenience, or obstacle, the difficulty of adapting to this new openness, emptyness, creating our own constraints etc
to react to that with a desire to essentially return to the non-human constraints
to be relieved of the empty canvas

Been thinking about it. Think I found it, root source of the divide. Not going to leave too much of a response here, there isn't much of a response needed, it's more something I need to think about more. But I'll tell you a little. Uncomfortable, been uncomfortable with my theory for a while. Think I've been looking at people backwards. Somehow, I started with a vision of primitive society and thought "that's what my instincts are evolved for," and that's totally backwards, fucked. Been operating off that one for years, maybe since I was a teen. Carried it over from my mom's nutritional/lifestyle approach, which is a better application of a "primitive society" model.
But that isn't it, it's backwards.
Primitive society was just one permutation, one application of our instincts.
That's why it immediately forms something much larger at the slightest opportunity.
Empires, civilization.
Our social instincts aren't as limited as I'd been thinking. Crippling, it's a crippling theory.
I'm really happy with the new avenues of possibility this is opening. But I still think that there has to be a way to bring better social/moral function to modern society.
Avatar
bjorn96 28-Sep-20 09:16 PM
Very interesting to see you explain your own thought process, from some distance
I will think about your formulation
Better social/moral function, I agree, but I am certain it will happen through an intuitive and personal trajectory, through schism and selection, transformation
we are still in a transition state
Primitive society
I'm gonna think about primitive society, the way you framed it

weir 28-Sep-20 09:21 PM
I'm thinking about PAC, I'm thinking about how algorithms (and humans) need to limit what they're considering at any given time. Somehow that's equivalent to the extremely immediate prosocial instincts, but then you've got this whole other area for beneficial connections, and it's almost mathematical.
I need to think about it more.
But I still want to tell you, I don't want to revert, I'm not trying to escape exactly. I think I might have wanted that once, but not for a long time.
I do want distance, or I've sought distance, but it was a temporary thing, was hoping to see more clearly.

I loved your description of horseback riding because it constitutes an ideal metaphysics, in my opinion. A constant state of tension, a process, an engagement, a kind of intimate struggle, mutual annihilation, yet communion.
What you renounce, which I saw remnants of in you, is the opposite, the metaphysics of a hard nosed horse
I sortof attack you as an avatar for parts of myself
Escaping, reverting, I see as a rejection of the constant state of tension

If I were in a real-life conversation (and it often happens this way) and I were to become tangental, exploratory, the conversation partner may become annoyed by this.

what are enfolded spaces
Avatar
bjorn96 28-Sep-20 09:52 PM
It's not a technical term
What I mean is an object where each dimension is enfolded in all others
So that each dimension relies on other dimensions to describe their contents
Like
Two binary distinctions vs a 2x2 grid
The binary distinctions know their state and don't care about the other distinction
But in a 2x2 grid, if let's say the top left square is active/full
Each dimension will have .5 probability of active at location 0
And can only fully determine the state in conjunction with the other dimension
The whole, unambiguous signal exists only as a communion of several dimensions
But what fascinates me is that, if we assume that every activation, every "event", is determined by a fixed number of binary distinctions, then each dimension can actually estimate how many other dimensions it needs to find and commune with to become whole
Its internal structure reveals what it must find which is outside of it
The theory I talked about, that I want to make a more systematic exposition of, a pdf,
The gist is that the (or at least a) primary distinction in vertebrate brain organization, certainly in mammals, is between these two
Integrated, "enfolded" spaces, which corresponds to conjunctions of events
And segregated distinctions
But it's just another hunch
We'll see

Reaction, fear, instinctive desire. These are disjunctive. Which is to say, they transcend contexts and 'rooms'
To an extent
'divergent thinking'
One key element to keep in mind
We usually think of space as three dimensions, or spacetime as four. Here, we reduce each dimension to a binary distinction, but we have millions of distinctions. The difficult part of creating a mental object is not to specify a region in space, but to specify the space itself, by selecting a small number of dimensions from the million, that happen to capture a pattern

Same dichotomy as always, another example
Things you have to finds, vs things you have to check, verify
E.g. open ended vs yes-no questions
Elaboration vs evaluation
Elaboration requires intricate organization, dependencies, memory and exactness
Conjunctive
Evaluation requires having as many simple independent units as possible
Sampling them gives a deep statistical result without explanation
It's like the chorus in Greek drama
They represent the masses, the folk wisdom, inarticulate and binary
Or Virgil leading Dante through hell
Or Plato's daemon whom he always listens to
Or claims to
When the disjunctive, evaluating mind is ignored
Things go bad, perhaps slowly, but inevitably
I think visual snow, somatic prickling, pins and needles, unpleasant urgency are symptoms
Many tiny units shouting in complete discoordination
The aesthetic judgement that does not explain itself is the antidote to painful exactingness, theoryful self-distortion
That's one of the ideas I'm pursuing for myself

Whenever you have two ideas
Two things
Two principles
There will be a direction in which heat, light, movement, change or force is flowing â€” or a direction in which knowledge, structure, complexity is flowing. From one to the other. When both gradients coincide, they flow against each other.
And thus we obtain the universal dichotomy, the infinite series of pairs
Counterexamples would be interesting
To be precise, whenever you have an interaction or communion of two things
Not just two separate things
Interaction, communion, comparison, distinction, etc

It contains the greatest amount of information, it is as formal as it can be. given only two compartments
Because given a single particle's charge, you know with absolute certainty which half it is in
And if you pick a particle from a compartment of choice, you know with absolute certainty what charge it will have
That's what a battery is
The universe resists information
It is willing to create movement, in order to dissolve this highly ordered state of affairs
We set it up so that she, feminine entropic Becoming, can only dissolve our ordered state by exerting force on something we want to push
An engine
Or by heating something, a light bulb
We harness her rage against gradients, against distinction
And so she pulls our ploughs
Information is lost
And energy gained
Information is generally created at the cost of energy, so it appears to be symmetrical

'External reality'
My version of 'society'
Haha
But external reality is a very confused idea
Outside the brain, you almost instinctively think, but then
Once you consider the notion of 'reality outside, outside the container' in detail
It becomes clear that something is wrong
Our notion of 'room', the cognitive phenomenon, can be described as That which has no exterior
Just as an atom, in the cognitive sense, has no interior
And we always try to fit the world into these three structures
Things with outsides, containing or comprising things without insides, contained by something with no outside

I think it might have been related to cellular consciousness or something, think I meant that at the most basic level, entities which act have to differentiate between themselves and the world somehow.
acting entities, have to have an idea of inside and outside, or it doesn't work. That was the idea, although I'm not sure if it's true, and obviously "having an idea" isn't quite what I mean

no, I've given extensive thought to this and it's nice to see you find the same independently
homeostasis, arguably the defining feature of life, requires a stable representation of 'normal state of self', to which the actual state can be compared, so the difference can be counteracted
so life is self-consciousness, if you accept this representational symbolic conception of self-consciousness
perhaps self-similarity is less presumptuous
self-representation

and the simplest form is a boundary separating inside from outside
so you can have i.e. different pH inside than outside
keep the things you produce
prepare sufficient stuff for two, while keeping it separate from the exterior
so when you're ready you can polarize

Avatar
bjorn96 28-Sep-20 11:46 PM
but really, they are the same, energy = randomness = change = chaos
at the lowest level
change is always relative to the regularities that have emerged so far
if it's changing cyclically within a pattern, that's only change in a limited sense
a more full sense of change would be breaking the patterns that have emerged
If everything that happens is completely cyclical, predictable. Then you can only measure time within that cycle
Time has no meaning beyond it
only a change that is different marks, and creates, and is time
and we call it randomness, though that's only our perspective on it
something we couldn't model
and energy is an entirely infered thing
we measure it by seeing how fast something moves, how dense it is
and so energy is a measure of time
there are nuances and angles, but time = energy = disorder = randomness = chaos

weir 28-Sep-20 11:50 PM

bjorn96 28-Sep-20 11:50 PM

information, order is the absense of time, resistance to time
something that is the same across moments
has to be relative to some time keeper of course
so information requires a segmentation of the world into two parts moving at different rates

Information, Energy and levels
levels is probably the next thing, in terms of generality, importance
it's an aspect of information
You can also subdivide information, or the causes of information
and this is a rather practical and important philosophical question
We are teaching machines to predict the future based on the past, assuming an unchanging distribution
but why are things ever the same in the first place
Why do patterns repeat themselves at all?
more than by random chance

patterns repeat themselves, and not by chance
if a thing occurs,
you drop a metal ball into clay on planet earth today
it's information interacting, relating
maybe more than information, I don't know
if you do it again, you get the same results, because it relates in the same way
although if you did it on the moon you'd get different results
no longer relates the same way as it did on earth

Relationships exist in a way individual things don't

that is persists

the thing is, a point in space is always relative, either to some other salient spot like a central mark, or to the observer. So we can never observe a thing, outside of relation. It's relations at the bottom. Things exist only relative to the relations they participate in,
as 'above' exists relative to a particular line and observer, 'information' exists in the reference frame of information-energy
We experience the whole frame, with a part standing out
And when we are sufficiently verbal creatures, we can imagine things independent of their contexts, but these are new relations

Every moment of experience is a new transformation of the world, we never get deeper, every moment adds another layer on top
Hopefully this takes us somewhere good, but it doesn't take us to the thing behind the phenomena, the cause itself
And so, when we see a star
It is defined by its color and shape, which is a very complex and enfolded set of distinctions from other visual objects, and it is defined by its location relative to some set of landmarks
Experience is to be this relation between landmarks, contrasts, reference frame and the thing we focus on, the figure
Verbal analysis is really weird and special
it does this thing where it performs a few stereotyped transformations on memories of recent experiences, percepts
One thing it will do is single out the figure, the focus of a recent perceptive experience

bjorn96 29-Sep-20 12:13 AM
We think we can look inside things
take things apart
But we're constructing a completely new experience, based on memory traces of a past experience
So we can delude ourselves that the star is a thing, alone
but it is never experienced, except as a center of the frame it is in
which can be the sky the moment it is perceived, or the frame of "I am looking just at the thing itself now, detached from relation, look, no relations!"
Then a third thought appears, which looks at the memory traces of the two first thoughts: The initial impression of the star, and the moment of believing the star is a thing, not a whole relation
And this third thought traces a line between the first two and concludes that we "took out" the star from its context, its relations
And a fourth thought concludes that the star, then, must be a thing
and relations must be made up of things
But the relation was first

In Oldboy
this stupid middle aged guy goes drinking with a friend, makes a complete fool of himself, is in and out of a police station, walks in the rain, it's dark
he's taken, kidnapped
he's kept for 15 years in a cell
made to look like a hotel room
there's tv
he gets served food by anonymous guards
then he's let out
he thinks he escaped of his own accord, digging for years with a chopstick
but he's soon contacted
"Welcome to life in a bigger prison"
He's told to think back at whom he has crossed, insulted, hurt
"Whether a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink the same"
I think I like the movie so much because that's how I feel
a bigger prison
and some kind of guilt, or sin
original sin
it's just a feeling
an extreme propensity for guilt

Dopamine and serotonin both can cause hallucinations, but different ones
The serotonergic hallucinator knows he is hallucinating
Typically
Feels detachment, fragmentation
Feels as if his body his not his perhaps
The dopaminergic hallucinator is religious and beyond duality
The hallucination is about ultimate significance
He sees patterns everywhere
Milder doses of dopamine can cause behavior like rearranging things

I taught myself to meditate when I was a kid, it wasn't something I had ever been exposed to. Just naturally came about at one point, reminds me of rearranging things a little.
Because it started like this, I woke up early, nobody up, just me. Seven, I was seven I think, maybe eight. And I went out to the goat pasture in the early morning
needed a place to sit
and the pasture, it was all dust, but big flagstone chunks of rock. angular
so I gathered a bunch and started fitting them together
until they made a seat
that was the whole idea, at first, go sit in the goat pasture
but then I started trying to ignore flies, because there was a lot and I had too much of a reaction to them
and that turned into trying to ignore everything
goats coming up and sniffing me
but it's the arranging that made me think of it, might flow both ways
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 01:26 AM
Very interesting and seems dopaminergic
It helped you discover something
These two states are two ways to deal with the unknown, error, being wrong
Prediction error
Dopamine: Make your model vaster, allow for more distant and tentative connections, sample more data
Serotonin: Accept that your model is different from actual reality and act accordingly
I.e. avoid risk and effort, or somehow act in a way that is robust to errors
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 01:29 AM
that makes sense
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 01:29 AM
Feeling of unreality
Is an acceptance of a faulty model
Fragmentation
Dopamine and serotonin both probably work on subsystems that can connect or disconnect, talk to each other
Serotonin makes them less ambitious in communicating with each other
Leading to a fractured self

I recognise the state now
I remember years ago, going to the grocery store, having forgotten something, wallet I guess, having to go again. And after that I felt like, wasting time like this, my whole schedule is a joke, I'm not making any progress
I think it's the same statr
I wonder if it's a serotonin drop, or an event with low serotonin as background and what the essence of the situation is
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 01:49 AM
For me I think I gave up on the plan forcibly, analytically. And probably I would have been a little down, not energetic for a while, looking for something new.
might be analogous to a breakup, although I wouldn't know personally
but then I had to continue going to suddenly less useful classes, and it was that constraint I think that brought out hostility

Yes yes exactly
You better change it or I'm gonna leave, this isn't worth it, I'll look for something else
If the perceived value/effort ratio suddenly drops a lot, like when you reevaluate it and find it's not a good path
That should make you much more open to leaving, so a depletion of serotonin presumably
But then some highly abstract, social mechanism forces you to stay, keep doing it
While the settings drop is encouraging all kinds of escape attempts
Or rebellion

very tired, and I'm going to sleep. was trying to sleep, and I thought of something. Consider it light, or boring, a nothing. Wanted to tell you regardless.
climbing stairs in the dark, you can't see them
an uncertain number, is it seven? did you lose count? familiar stairs, and yet you've forgotten halfway up
When it happens going up, it's not the feeling of falling that happens when you're going down and miss a step and go down too far, or the floor is unexpected.
it's different, you think you're at the top, and you go to step upon the floor, and instead find yourself on yet another step, much higher elevation than anticipated.
so unexpectedly climbing, that's the feeling I was thinking of
that's what I wanted to tell you for some reason, go figure. gonna sleep now.

I remember reading something about reward prediction errors, and how you'd get a spike for any result that deviated from expectations
and I think I was trying to read something else at one point, one that had a pain-signal not just a "reward" of money
it's about salience, I guess
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 04:51 PM
yeah there are at least two distinct dopamine "signals"
one that gives little rhythmic discharges at a certain level
but when something "rewarding" happens, this level increases a bit
and vice versa for lack of expected reward, or punishment
and then there's a salience signal in another region, where it just bursts when somthing unexpected happens
that's important
And then, in behavioral psych, 'reward' is defined as something an animal will work for
so 'reward' is defined by effort
and the "brain reward system" that dopamine is part of is somehow simultaneously doing learning and pursuit
somehow our concepts are not right
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 04:53 PM
in animal training, there is "positive reinforcement" and "negative reinforcement," things that shape the behavior
not sure where I'm going with that, carrot and stick obviously

there's a deeper unity underlying boredom, engagement, reward, punishment
Friston's theory, with prediction errors and "active inference" is an attempt to solve this, a good attempt, but not satisfying to me
He explains all behavior as a form of curiosity
It's not that we want to eat a candy, we want to know what it's like to eat the candy
It's not that we want to win, we want to know either whether we can win, or what it's like to win
habits cause repetition of reliable behaviors discovered through this curiosity
cause us to do things when we already know that we can and what it's like

before we talked often, you were using twitter a lot, and talking to me as well. I wanted to be friends, wanted to be able to discuss things with you etc. wanted to matter to you.
but you were tweeting a lot of stuff, couldn't reasonably parse which was just stuff, and which, if any, related to me
so I put no weight on it
and you had this one tweet, about trying to talk over gossiping demons, trying to tell someone "you are precious to me"
and it made me feel sad, I thought "I wish that were true"
and feelings-wise, it was not rewarding, it didn't feel true
but I thought about it, reasoned, realized that I did matter to you, because you spent a lot of time on me, so somehow I was helpful
so that was an example of a split, feelings going one way, need immediate reinforcement
but analytically, could look at examples and say "it must be a certain way, reality looks like this"
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 05:19 PM
feelings-wise it was not rewarding
most 'rewards' or 'reinforcers' have no relationship to a specific stimulus or behavior to be repeated or avoided. They are subjectively meaningful, but what exactly they mean can be very abstract and have consequences very distant from the stimulus-response
What you write is subjectively meaningful to me, salient

but if you add the attentional modulation
you can maybe have two dimensions one for each, analytical (attention) and emotion (internal)
uh, you would call this perception and action I think
this is not firm ground for me
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 05:48 PM
internal is slippery because things can stop existing
internal is like an essence of who you are, your deepest values and axioms

not sure either
modulation and attention is about sorting, selecting
perception is about searching, exploring

I'm probably trying to hard to leverage superficial similarities, just reminds me of beauty and sense

weir 29-Sep-20 05:53 PM
and maybe both are operating, building the map, from fragmentary data, small instances
but the data differs in source, in type. at root, I mean, very far down. Later it becomes interrelated.

ideas

yes, certain abstract, long-term goals like "degree" don't hold sway over the resisting thing
although I think it's because I don't value "degree" emotionally at all
it's sensible, and it's selfish, and it doesn't seem necessary, just practical.
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 06:12 PM
Joy and Rage are two aspects of the same. Sadness and Happiness (the calm, compassionate kind) too. And these play out within a person, not just between people.
To resist something, a task you 'have' to do, but feel a strong emotional reaction against
this resistance is also joy
though it doesn't register as that to the memory that is recorded, the high level self-perception
because the thing that resists, it doesn't do marketing and it doesn't write history, so to speak
so it is portrayed in this nasty way
because it's not in the business of high level patterns
it's in the business of individual parts, their costs in terms of effort, or their value in terms of simple, immediate enjoyment
Joy is aggressive
It is threatening to outsiders, in some cases
I will need to formulate this in a way that is more clear and compelling
I'll think about it more
But I think it's true

When you're conflicted, one part wants to do schoolwork and another wants to pursue temptations or personal passions
these are two agents
they're made up of neural circuits
competing in the brain
once one achieves enough central consolidation to take unambiguous control of the subcortical structures, we say that a decision has been made
Both agents are in a state of joy
that is, they unhesitatingly pursue their vision
A book in bed, or getting responsibilities done
But the mass media of the mind
The narrating self of language and episodic memory
It can only side with one of them
It will change sides at irst
go back and forth
Joy is the agent the narrative self sides with
It knows its plans and rhetoric well, but is also somehow very blind to it
being too close to it
While the other side it sees as a parody, either lazy Rage or annoying Guilt/Nagging responsibility
The agent itself, the neural phenomenon trying to take control of behavior, insofar as it has emotion, it is joy
The dynamic perspective taking within ourselves, that's mostly unknown to people
It's completely missed by Freudian thinking, at least as it is popularly used
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 06:22 PM
voting, it reminds me of the voting mentioned in the grid cell paper
you've got two agents
trying to accomplish a task
one says "this is valuable"
and the other is says "this is sensible"
and they're both right
but who wins
and it's really nice when they can agree on something
when the sensible degree is a challenge and therefore valuable
or when the valuable thing is also sensible
either way, I guess
but often there's a conflict, very dry long-term goals, related to something that isn't really that valuable, in an immediate sense
that was the thing about "shoulds"
don't need them to survive
they don't make anyone proud
there is some sort of negative consequence to not pursuing them, but it's small and not immediate
I think it totally makes sense to have these two factors at war with each other, or at least allowed to disagree

Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 06:28 PM
I really want to find a technical and rigorous definition of this distinction, you'r eright, it's emotions vs ideas
so one possibility I have a lot of faith in is
the thing I talked about yesterday
disparate factors, non-interacting
voting, as you say
vs interacting, non-linear spatial models
Two ways to find an answer. You either ask 10 people and pick the most common reply
or you build a complex model where you rule things out, and combine many different rules
to generate an answer where you can explain your reasoning
But the latter kind is not only super expensive, it's actually really unstable
Because when you have a lot of power over how you model something, it's too easy to fit your hypothesis to the data, cheating
that way you miss the deeper thing and your hypothesis ends up not predicting the future
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 06:31 PM
that makes sense, I'm thinking about it
this is probably just cause you mentioned joy/rage but I really want to go look at PARCS see where it lines up
skimming, I'm barely skimming but reactive being more about novelty, emergency etc. more immediate, also more "emotional"
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 06:39 PM
yeah definitely
emotion corresponds to reactive in the dichotomy
The linear model, many votes, no interaction, it changes smoothly with the environment.
If there's a sudden change in the environment, even if it doesn't have a pattern that is in itself meaningful, the linear model will change too
If the environment is superficially stable, the linear model is also stable
the non-linear integrated spatial model though
It will have sudden dramatic shifts, even in a stable environment
Because it has so many assumptions that it could change its mind about
And because everything interacts, a single changed assumptions can change everything
The former is stable because one vote matter very little. It's also quick because there's no latency, each individual is not hindered by strong ties to others
In the latter, it exhibits chaotic behavior where it suddenly changes completely, sometimes due to no obvious stimulus
But also latency, it can be very slow to adapt to a change
Like a big organiztion
This is very contradictory and therefore hard to grasp. Both forms of organization exhibit stability and instability, in opposite ways

bjorn96 29-Sep-20 06:45 PM
Dramatic shifts, but two totally different kinds, that look different on the surface
A dramatic shift in behavior is either a very reactive system in an environment that just changed, or it's a very predictive system in a stable, but difficult-to-decode environment
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 06:47 PM
I think she's reactive, but I could be wrong
usually she starts with a positive assumption about someone, pastes it onto them "they're great!"
and then when that assumption is proven wrong, she almost punishes them for the discrepancy "they suck so much"
and then back to the first, if they do something nice
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 06:48 PM
It's nuanced
On one hand, it's predictive, because she goes from "they did one thing I dislike" to "they suck" which is a prediction, because it's about their essence

We've talked about evolution as a learning process, it also throws stuff til it sticks, you could say
But say you throw things at a wall, as the metaphor goes
and some things stick, but in such a way that a pattern is formed
Say it's a perfect circle
Formed by things you've thrown, everything else falls down
The circle represents 'what works'
And clearly, the circle exists prior to anything being thrown
In the same way, what works in evolution exists prior to its discovery by the evolutionary process
The adaptiveness of the four limbs, head with a face schema of vertebrates
Of other organizational principles
The adaptiveness of the form exists prior to any exploration or discovery of it by biological matter

Light as universal reference frame is another important piece of the puzzle, an idea I don't understand well enough
In the past, physicists believed that there must be a reference frame for light too, some medium it moves through
Because light behaves like a wave
And waves generally occur in a medium
Like if you have a sheet of textile, you can make a wave in it, jerk one end and the energy will travel through
Or dropping something in calm water
So what material is light rippling through?
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 07:32 PM
is there a thing in contrast to wave, waves occur in a medium?
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 07:33 PM
Typically a particle is thought of as an alternative
being itself part of a medium
A wave is a description of many particles, where individual ones move very slightly, forming a large scale movement
Waves are a description of a movement
so it seems as if something must be moving
for there to be a wave

I should look up light waves
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 07:37 PM
Look at a rope
or a chain
When two people hold it at a distance, extended
and one moves it up and down quickly
sending jolts of energy into it essentially
One part goes up, pulling up the next part at a delay
and when the next part is reaching the top, the first part has already passed on all its energy and is going down
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 07:37 PM

Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 07:38 PM
haha
not necessarily
but if light is really a wave, reaches a top and is then pulled down again, like the chain
then we expect something analogous to the physical chain
causing that
Maybe the idea of light as a wave is wrong though
I think it's mostly based on interference patterns
not sure
Anyway, physicists came up with the idea of the ether
a lightweight material that light passes through
But it didn't really work it seems, and the conclusion they reached was that Light is kinda absolute
Which is beautiful and seems trueish
The obsessive need for a medium seems wrong, as you also seem to have found

Light can become heat, electricity
in highly structured forms, it becomes force
the fact that things are 'solid', that we can touch them, is really their ability to exert force
so the solidness of things, physical matter, is also intimately tied to light
a form of light maybe, or a rougher aspect, contained within light, shed by it

An organism expects oxygen
Expectation = instinct = what works
What works, physical matter randomly bumping into each other, but the forms that replicate or maintain themselves end up dominating, tautologically
But as the idea goes
The adaptive form is adaptive prior its discover, exists prior
And so it is an expectation
Instinct
The behavior of an organism may not yet have been manifested
but it exists as personality, character, instinct, prior to being discover
Now the organism is a kind of cosmos for the things it interacts with
Instead of natural laws, the organisms nervous system defines the law of its microcosm, its environment

weir 29-Sep-20 08:10 PM
the static pattern must relate to a specific environment, environmental range

so the relation must be constant, constant enough, or it will cease to be a relation, organism dies
instincts are expectations of the environment
of the relation

I think expectation is the wrong word, although it still has some depths I would like to see more clearly
I think it's more like an offering
You offer something
And there's a kind of expectation in that of course
an expectation that it might be useful, will be accepted, will be used a certain way, of reciprocation
but the expectation is secondary, an analysis reveals it, but it's not the essence
The essence is the offering, a hope, a joyous shining forth that may or may not be inhibited
inhibited, ignroed

It's uncomfortable to turn down someone offering something, because it's an act of violence

inhibition must match the activation

You know how brain function is believed to be built up of action potentials?
An action potential is a single firing of a neuron
Like, it builds up tension from its input dendrites
and when it passes a threshold, it opens its output gate
and fires
Avatar
weir 29-Sep-20 08:18 PM
go on
Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 08:18 PM
And other cells can latch on, inhibit either of these events, inhibit a dendrite inputting things, or inhibit the cell body from outputting
But electricity is not neatly following this schema
It's leaking all over the place and flowing
a field, a river
And the action potentials, believed to be the atom of cognition, is probably an attempt to CHANGE the flow
not the flow itself

You said things about light, the speed of light as the fastest we can perceive

Avatar
bjorn96 29-Sep-20 08:25 PM
First it's important to know there are two main kinds of inhibitory cells
Some inhibit the cell body, the "whole cell"
Others just inhibit individual dendrites coming in, effectively changing the circumstances under which the cell will respond
Now inhibitory cells inhibiting the whole cell, they create the gamma rhythm, it seems
create a rhythm through inhibition
intercepting
First a moment of vulnerability, letting the sensory stream change the values
then a moment of stillness, to look at it

weir 29-Sep-20 08:27 PM

bjorn96 29-Sep-20 08:27 PM

it's rejection actually
but only very subtle
push and pull, to perceive the other
to be changed by the other, but also push back
inhibition rejects incoming sensory data
thus making it intelligible

party dresses and gas masks. best friend's birthday, she was twelve and I was ten, or thirteen and eleven. We're wearing party dresses, little girls. It's a girly party, there were cucumber sandwiches cut into triangles, a tea party. Scones or something, platters of cookies. A few other girls there. I remember it was a blue day, some clouds. Her dad was a little crazy, and he got upset over "chemtrails" and told us we couldn't play outside because there were especially bad chemtrails currently. It doesn't make sense now, and it barely made sense then. There were crops nearby, perhaps he'd seen them actually being sprayed with pesticides. But in the end, we trooped into the garage and got gasmasks, trying them on so we could go outside. They were heavy and ugly, we're standing there in our kid-dresses and our best shoes and we're trying to figure out how to wear these grey rubber things. In the end we decided they smelled bad, musty, so we left them alone and went back to the cucumber sandwiches.
I guess that was only one, but I should sleep. Have to wake up early for a school thing.

Up early and it's dark outside. Reminding me of waiting for the bus in the cold January mornings, dark and the headlights come swooping towards me. The first day, the bus driver almost didn't see me standing there waiting, no streetlight above me. Last minute decision to stop, pulling over to the sidewalk at high velocity, headlights arcing towards me. Up the grimy metal stairs with my handful of quarters, and the driver she's telling me "Hon, I can't see you, you got a phone? You gotta shine it at me hon, it's too dark."
Avatar
weir 30-Sep-20 12:58 PM
Funny cause I didn't haveto take that bus, there was another thirty minutes later that would do, but just barely, and I hate to be late. So I'd get to campus in the mornings, too early, deserted. Cold and quiet, everything foggy, I'd go read in the gardens. Eventually my professor found out that we both got there early, so he'd get me to come in to the classroom and help him set up the tables, after that I'd sit there reading my books til class started, which I liked because it was warmer inside, and dry.

this sense that every idea is a meeting, observer and agent
the observer is passive, but the agent has no meaning without it
we trade places
we both play both roles at times
But I notice it at the level of ideas
An idea that is brilliant in the evening, a symphony, is a naked unaccompanied whimper in the morning
it has no chords
and so it's no longer beautiful
it can be rebuilt, but it needs this aura, this audience
and people are like that too

I'll unfold. I was thinking about it last night actually.
you're like a tsunami of new information
and I almost always understand you
but I don't understand everything that predicates your concepts, by which I mean
I tend to dig very deep into things until I understand all the details, or most of them
so it's uncommon for me, and wonderful to be forced to let go of that a little
you're talking about neurons and time and electricity, and I love it
and there's no way to fully understand everything, not all at once
stretches me, think it's really good for me
being forced to give up on having total and detailed understanding

I thought of three analogies
one man searching in the dark, empty handed and open minded
one man searching with a map, not knowing what's waiting there

I notice a lot of kids will hide in the clothes racks
especially circular ones
push into the center, it's a hiding spot
you're safe from the horrors of the store, but you're also ready to pounce on something, and you're not supposed to, so it's delightful.
My mom saw another mom yelling at her kid for doing that once, hiding in the clothes. Hot day, stuck in her car, looked like she might start hitting the kid.
My mom threw a bag of carrots at her and scolded her, told her that all kids do that.

I am always surprised when you message me, always happy. Think I might be kinda stupid in this way, by which I just mean I never think you get as much from me as I do from you. Not you specifically, it's an old wound. It goes deeper. I've been lonely.

fingertips against your cheeks, eyelids
press my face against your neck, I'm tucked under your jaw
imagine this, I'm doing dishes. soap and water and my hands are wet. you come and tease me, brushing hair away from neck.
you're sliding your hands around my waist, pulling me close
somehow these hold my emotion better than a simple word, a name
to simply say I adore you, it's not enough
I used to go with my mother to the contra dances
never anyone my age, a dying artform
always a live band, all night
pause for a potluck, pans of brownies and potato chips, I'm sitting outside on the cold railing, legs swinging
once in the middle of the dance, and once at the very end the band will play a waltz
and it always made me sad, feel very alone
there's no connotation with that. it's just emotion.
the boy I kissed, he asked me to teach him how to dance, so I did, humming a waltz. Old man was watching, smoking a pipe, an actual pipe of all things. He told us that we were doing it wrong, I'd accidentally taken the lead.
which makes me laugh, that's a funny thing
not so sad

Avatar
weir 30-Sep-20 06:47 PM
was sat next to him on the train. He tried to kiss me after hours of conversation, and I turned my face, forehead against his.
could hear him softly sort of protesting, a chuckle
so I whispered into his ear, I've never been kissed
and he pulled away like he'd been burned
staring at me, accused me of lying
I denied it
and when, cautiously, he tried again, I held very still. It was a calculation, I was curious. I liked him alright, but used him like a knife, like salt.
he was cold and tasted of smoke I thought "is that it?"
later I found him softening to me, he didn't understand what I was. He became uncertain, hours more of conversation. I got his number, never called. He wasn't right but I wish him well.

softening, asking me things. No longer a stranger as much, a toy or distraction. He wanted answers to questions, to be seen.
I saw him, but was invisible, I think. Not good with my words, he sometimes misunderstood me.

news travels down trains
we saw the ambulance
there was a general concern that he might die on the scene
because if he did the train would be legally bound to stay for the whole investigation, or some shit like that
A dead body would be a longer delay, basically. That was the concern. And they said he'd been hit by another train too, going the other way.

Retina -> thalamus -> visual cortex
As a model to understand the cortex generally
and the thalmocortical circuit
The thalamus projects to Layer 4 of visual cortex
Layer 4 is special, because it's missing in older parts of cortex that you find near the subcortical structures
like cingulate, hippocampus, limbic

Whatever role retinal input plays in visual cortex, that role is missing in what older cortex is doing

expectation?
Avatar
bjorn96 30-Sep-20 07:31 PM

expectation
so maybe older cortex just knows how to do things, but doesn't have an idea of what it should look like
and then it interacts with newer cortex cyclically
Someone with a goal recruiting someone who just predictably does a certain program
And the one who just predictably does a program, following instructions will also call on the goal-directed one as part of the program, at times

I spent so much time around animals, it's shocking whenever I get a glimpse of how other people see them,
I don't mean emotionally, "aww they're so cute" etc
but like, how they think
that they do think
people are retarded
you've got people trying to train their dogs, and
it's so bad

It's communication, training is communication.
it's like seeing a foreigner go somewhere and try to order food by shouting
but in their native tongue
they never try to bridge the gap, don't try to understand the animal. They don't understand what training is, they just imitate what they think it is.

I've actually heard about that, experienced it
it's super interesting
I think in this three-level model of search/action
the first is based entirely on vigor
You do something more or less intensely
not do something, just do
the specifics are shaped elsewhere
And pacing is sortof generic doing
vigor, unshaped
Then the third level is where you have an explicit representation of the result you're trying to get
and the second level, in between, it shapes what you do, without a representation of the result, but somehow implicitly learns whether or not it's being useful
Avatar
weir 30-Sep-20 07:52 PM
yeah, that seems right
when people try to train their dogs, they have an end goal
but no clear idea of the steps required to get there
so they just repeat the command with emphasis
sometimes get mad
childish, maybe. very blunt.
it's like they don't have the second level going on at all
Avatar
bjorn96 30-Sep-20 07:54 PM
Yeah that makes sense
They have a picture of what the dog should look like
And they can obviously regulate vigor
louder
more intense
but not the second level
Second level, I'm hypothesising, includes cingulate cortex and hippocampus

weir 30-Sep-20 07:55 PM
hippocampus, that's memories? I'll google
Avatar
bjorn96 30-Sep-20 07:56 PM
That's a common interpretation
episodic memory
But nature doesn't know what an episodic memory is
So it must be coding a certain kind of information, of which episodic and spatial memroy happens to fit

I think the brain is like a sysem of nets, with mask of different sizes
so they catch different things
and episodic memories have certain features
they're very dense, compact
very linear
they're not a procedure for achieving a result, they're more like pure behaviors, or pure events that happen
hippocampus is really important for space
hmm

bjorn96 30-Sep-20 08:15 PM
there's procedural memory
how to ride a bike
there's declarative memory, like knowing historical facts
It's a classification I've just inherited, not questioned much

are special somehow

then I remember the ER, yellow light and antiseptic, doctor made a balloon out of a glove for the kid in the next room with a broken leg

based on what is considered important, a precedent
the crickets are important
because I thought it was going to be evening, that I should hurry home, so I was riding really fast.
stitches, I needed stitches
so they're attached to this whole thing too
because I remember my dad taking them out at his workbench in the garage, magnifying monocle and bright light, made me hold ice on my chin til it was numb
chronological time seems irrelevant. It holds whatever was unusual, important about it. the things that stood out.

what I remember and care about is mostly just the events

drawing new conclusions
not reliving what I thought and felt at that time

I enjoy books, but it's almost always about what I get from them, what ideas they spark in me.

the opposite is also plausible though

simply because it outlasts us completely

It's an important property, hard to find the best characterization
if I understand correctly what you're trying to do
That the instrument of our perception and cognition is somehow partial, because it belongs to one and not the other of the objects being investigated
So the representation we use, language and theoretical analysis, in one case is talking about itself, and in the other talking about something opposite of itself

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 04:49 PM
let's try to get something here
nothingness and infinity
Bergson has a perfect formulation on this
The idea of Nothing contains more than the idea of Being
It contains Being and a negation of it, a contrast between something expected and a formulation of what the opposite would be
It's telling that long words, words with extra prefixes come later, are less obvious
in-finite
no-thing
So to investigate those two ideas, we should first have a clear grip on 'finite' and 'thing'
Or duration and being

bjorn96 01-Oct-20 04:54 PM
It's all the same topic I think
Zero is infinite, nothingness is infinite
These are good claims
I think we will elucidate all these claims
The basic principle I am suggesting, to understand these claims
A 'thing', whether it's a noun or an adjective or a verb, a positive entity, is a description of certain necessary conditions
for it to be this thing
So that's quite easy to compute, to think about, we check, does it satisfy these conditions? If not, it's not this thing
But when we negate, when we use negative entities like infinity and nothing
We basically say, anything except this
It's much harder to compute
And it's really up in the air if it's going to have some "essence" or not
Like, what's the essence for all things that are not a cup
maybe it doesn't exist, maybe it's a random collection of things

Negative concepts can be easy to compute in very limited, well-formed problems
"All letters not a" is pretty easy, we get to the bottom of it
but when there's no such closed frame, it's impossible to ever compute the actual contents of a negation
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 05:00 PM

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 05:00 PM
What we do is we sample it, we look at some examples and try to generalize
For example non-living things
The idea brings up examples that we can compare
and probabilistically create for ourselves a category of non-living things, without having exhausted the category by far
We get in the habit of doing this, so when someone says infinite, it feels as if this is a useful operation
It should be easy to make examples, because we know many things with duration or extension, things that are finite
It's a simple operation to let them expand as far as we can see
but then the formulation is like a trojan horse, it has this malicious pattern
where we need to expand endlessly
But what it produces is not endless
We eventually stop trying to imagine it after having expanded a while
So there's no actual infinity involved
That's the idea
I wonder what you think about infinity and nothing in light of that

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 05:16 PM
Yeah, 0 or Nothing has meaning as control parameters for certain operations
they usually just signify that an operation can be more or less complex
And 0 signifies the minimal complexity of a certain operation, on a certain parameter
For example
The operation +
Denotes a range of transformations
all of them lead to an outcome, a thing, a number
that number differs in how different it is from the prior number, in the extreme case (for the non-negatives) it is the same as the prior number
0 denotes this extreme case
extreme simplicity within a frame set down by the operation, which has no exterior (the exterior is behind the scenes of consciousness)
so adding 0 to 1 starts with 1 and ends up with a new instance that happens to be identical
this is an operation, something
but since we've put a border around the operation, so that we're only consciously aware of what's happening within its fixed rules, 0 denotes the baseline
where only the non-attended universals are present

weir 01-Oct-20 05:21 PM
this makes sense
I wrote this a 0 is a thing, it kinda means to take an action without taking the action. placeholder. but I'm having a hard time staying relevant
like there was a question back there, somewhere
and I forgot it
I know I can address this properly, there's an actual idea here, and I'm getting sucked into stupid abstract mind-loops.
sorry about that

0 means something entirely unsurprising
and thus implies no change in behavior
it means, keep going, it's exactly as expected

bjorn96 01-Oct-20 05:25 PM
a mind capable of sophisticated simulation and comparison between simulations will be able to expect being surprised
and then be surprised by the expected
and since we give names to surprising things, we name this 'nothing
'
Or at first, 'not that thing'
but when we expected to be surprised by a range of things, or by anything even
anything unexpected, salient
This is also confused
But what's clear is, if nothing can be explained in terms of something, we've succeeded
I think it's also important
the way we determine the boundaries of something is not by exhaustively exploring it
We just look for places where it changes from being to not being
Edges
And so infinity is pretty easy to imagine
Just don't imagine edges
that's infinity
a small part of it

time, you're talking about how people think of time? the concept of time?
and space
but the conception of it?
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 06:41 PM
We can distinguish in principle between the conception of it and time itself, but once we say anything about it, it inevitably is the conception
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 06:42 PM
yeah that's true but
I start trying to think about literal time, literal space
and it breaks me
I can't
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 06:43 PM
Time is often mapped as a spatial dimension, in math for example
in a timeline
Here we capture one property of time, that quantities can change over time
and that things appear and disappear, but only if we represent appearance as a quantitative value on a spectrum, 0 to 1
What's different about time, that's lost when we spatialize it
is the appearance of something new
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 06:44 PM
oh, that's where duration goes?
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 06:44 PM
I think so
Time can be thought of as a space containing possible spaces
that's again cheating, but it's pretty good
So the notion of a new dimension suddenly appearing or disappearing
That's time
A pretty close approximation, still a spatialization though
but that can't be helped
The only way to get closer to literal time is to stop thinking and talking, just watch experience
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 06:46 PM
time is beginnings and/or endings (maybe)

weir 01-Oct-20 06:48 PM
I think of time and I think of continuity, it goes forth unbroken. So that's the wrong layer, angle for this.
we're talking about properties of time
about what time does
which is allow for dimensions to blossom and collapse
it's like we're looking at the ripples, trying to see the water
or describe maybe, not see
idk
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 06:49 PM
I mix that up too so there's something important hidden there, what is continuous, space or time?
Which is a hill, which is a staircase
But even that question might be wrong
One angle that is useful for this is number systems. All numbers can be represented as a string of 0s and 1s.
Or you can have 0 to 9
or go even further
A single dimension
In the binary system, numbers are inventions
In a system with a higher base, or no base, it's more like discovering
But it might not be appropriate at the moment

Because space is a complex of distances
And a distance is a single line
the shortest line
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 06:58 PM
so space is an angular snarl of lines between objects
and a space
is a certain point within that snarl
a crossing of the lines, conjunction
that's really pretty, is that what you meant?
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 06:59 PM
An angular snarl is exactly right
A space as a point in space, this I'm not sure of
Avatar
weir 01-Oct-20 07:00 PM
a space might also be defined by the points contained within it
rather than a single point
or even edges
most things are the things that they contain
edges are too harsh
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 07:01 PM
most things are the things that they contain
So this is very important, especially because space is not

bjorn96 01-Oct-20 07:02 PM
Yeah, a part of space, I think so
but importantly, not a region bounded by sections of the individual dimensions
but bounded by selecting a subset of dimensions
Although, perhaps that's not true
Perhaps being "a space" just requires that what's outside the region is completely ignored

if it isn't a point in space, a thing then it's a mini-space, sharing all the properties of the other space

weir 01-Oct-20 07:22 PM
yes
that
a copy
and the other idea was that grid cells work off of movements, off motor input somehow. I think I read that in the paper
so I was wondering if maybe space
having an idea of distance, of space
like, imagine a new place that you've never been to before, imagine my backyard
it's got specific distances
and maybe forming an idea of space is kinda like running the copy, the emulation through some sort of grid-cell simulation
that's what it made me think of
it might be really stupid, it doesn't matter

What is the input to grid cells

And if frontoparietal network is an action emulation network, which I think is true, then does that happen through simulations with grid cells, if so where? And what's the circuit like

If you approach knowledge in a rigid, mechanical way, you can be sent on wild goose chases. If you take a more artistic approach, which involves skimming and looking for what stands out, letting connections form organically, that's robust
it can't really be damaged by information, at least it's very hard

I'm excited that you're reading about grid cells, that's really cool
Never hesitate to ask me, challenge me or suggest things
One thing about grid cells and neocortex vs older areas
As far as I know, grid cells have only been studied in the old parts, mostly entorhinal cortex
Jeff Hawkins, the Numenta guy, believes they exist all over cortex, including neocortex
He has theoretical reasons for believing it, not experimental
I think he's sortof right, except it's the wrong way of thinking about it.
There's a type of cell that learns to fire in a maximally informative way, it learns to mean many things, but avoids having two meanings that are too similar
When this is applied to space, it forms a grid
Because a grid is a maximal number of points, at maximal distance from each other
And so, the cell that when spatial forms a grid, is doing something analogous all over cortex, this I agree with

the biggest difficulty for me, the biggest bottleneck, is turning quantitative and gray words into colorful 'real' concepts
Once a concept becomes 'real', I can't stop myself from reading about it
Maybe you notice the same, idk. Like I suspect that 'grid cells' now evokes some color and imagery in you, has become a real thing
Having conversations, being asked questions about things make them real

That said
I don't think you really love someone deeply until you can hurt them just the right amount
It's the most difficult test of sensitivity and atunement
attunement
You can be infatuated, or comfortable
But that level of sensitivity is higher than, let's say, intimacy

I'm not sure, I'm happy with how things are now
I'm just making a general comment
People want to be hurt, because it means they're in the presence of something greater. But they also want to be greater than the things they're in the presence of.
I don't long for being touched, I'm taking a hiatus, courting a different kind of spirit
but when it happens, it's always unconsensual, and always a good thing

You can be patient in the face of defeat
I don't think patience is an attitude to your goal, as much as an attitude to resistance
Of course, resistance only makes sense if you're intentionally moving
So there's an implicit connection between patience and goals, even if the goal is just staying alive
But I think patience doesn't reflect on the goal
Although reflecting on the goal can trigger patience

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 09:07 PM
Yes
The brain is made of units, wrapped in markov blankets, little selves
Three types
Corresponding to classical notions of instinct, intuition and intelligence
at least roughly
The first knows only intensity, vigor
That's its only action
The second knows direction, departure points
The third starts with an image of the destination
The three use each other and rely on each other, circularly
When she says that frontoparietal/task network is for action emulation, that scientist is referring to the third kind, from a certain angle.
Seeing an action, what it looks like, going from that to actually doing it
Hearing someone play the harmonica, trying yourself by holding it to your mouth and screaming

Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 09:14 PM
Instinct, the lower caste, is subcortical nuclei. Not yet flattened into cortical sheet
Intuition is early cortex, now flat, but not yet layered, or only somewhat layered
Intelligence is neocortex, thick with many fine layers
That's my working hypothesis
One subcortical cluster of nuclei, the thalamus, plays a different role, but that can wait for now

habit, routine, a behavior you don't think about much
we figure out good things from a goal perspective
maybe I'm thinking compulsion, in relation to animals

bjorn96 01-Oct-20 09:34 PM
there's clearly a distinction here, that I must be careful not to sweep under the rug, between compulsion and habit
compulsion and intuitively knowing something is good, is related
distinct, but related
You can intuitively feel something is good, you've never done it before
You can compulsively feel drawn to it, something you're addicted to
You can do it without consciousness, a habit
These are different, but similar too

Sometimes you see a thing and you desperately want it, no idea how to get it, but then, the process of exploring possible plans etc has the same immediacy
no need to deliberately control the search, once you get out of the way
And I don't think it's possible for something to be automatic and still depend on imagination

smell, taste and sensation. these must be among the most basic. and then from there you're growing more numerous, in a PAC sense, more decisions to be made I think. this seems wrong but not sure why
I'll go find another thing
there's something I want to think about in regards to the neocortex, what it does
forms a picture of a landscape that can be manipulated
forms a picture of "things" and how they can relate to each other
running a simulation?
Avatar
bjorn96 01-Oct-20 09:54 PM
Smell is the oldest probably. Non-spatial. Each smell is qualitative. No relationship between smells. Taste is arguably part of smell.
Somatic, tactile must be extremely old.
But arguably more recent than smell (let's call it chemoception), because it's defensive rather than foraging, and it requires more intelligence to make use of

animals are curious because they have to generate information manually, little kids are curious because they don't have enough information yet, to form their picture of the landscape.
and the things in it
each thing has properties, and you can figure out how they relate
animals can't do that distantly
for little kids too, there's more immediacy, "out of sight, out of mind" works really well
but they LOVE to copy things

I want to understand the relationship between instinct and emotion
this seems really important to me
obviously instinct is close to emotion
seems almost sensory, internal reaction to input
but emotion is also super super wide in humans, I mean
non-immediate
emotion-landscape
values fit in here somewhere

bjorn96 01-Oct-20 10:36 PM
Panksepp lays out 7 emotional circuits, which I think is quite good
Seeking-Pursuit, Play, Care, Lust, Grief/Sadness, Rage, Fear
Some of it is closely tied to the lower third, the subcortical, beneath basal ganglia, instinct in our current terms
Seeking especially

So most of it is subcortical, really deep, below basal ganglia
instinct
but some have limbic cortex components
What he calls 'panic', but he really means separation, sadness, he calls it grief elsewhere
and care, nurturance
They are anterior cingulate
A favorite region of mine
Hypotheses about anterior cingulate include "value of control", "conflict resolution", "difficulty"
Fear, rage and lust have amygdala as well, which is a nucleus, but it's basically the tip of hippocampus
It might be the threshold between cortex and subcortex, you might say
possibly
and seeking has pretty advanced, neocortical frontal stuff, but then it's bordering between emotion and cognition

One thing I found, that is useful in itself, but also sheds light on this
is that starting to read difficult material is hard, but if I make a very simple search task, it can get me started
like, look through the chapter headlines, put bookmark for cool sounding ones
Or trying to predict what the first sentence will say before reading it
Simple stereotypical tasks like search, check, fight, go, they're easy to jump into

Twitter update. Requested my account data, and it seems to have worked for all the dms from your last account, the one that will expire. For the long-dead accounts prior to that, it gave me only my half of the conversation but I have all of our dms as screenshots anyway, so full message history is available, just not currently formatted for optimal readability.
Ok, that's out of the way, resolved. I'll send them to you sometime soon, but I'm going to sleep now.
Thank you for the book, I'm happy to have it. Extensive yet accessible.
Gonna sleep
Oh! Forgot, I wanted to tell you earlier.
I was outside this afternoon and there was a noise in the apple tree, strange repetitive. Grating, but sorta squeaky. Looked and I saw a squirrel, chewing on something.
Didn't know why it was making that noise though, horrible noise. Wood doesn't do that.
So I got closer and the squirrel, it had a rib bone, like from a cow or something. Pig maybe? And it was holding it, chewing on the edges. Think it was going for the marrow. Nasty sound it was making, flat teeth on bone.
It got kinda upset that I was looking so it carried the bone off. Holding this huge bone, running along the tree branch. Strange, kind of unsettling. I didn't know they liked bones.
ok, that's it gonna sleep

sad about the dream. in real life he is dying, slowly. Almost an old man, been badly alcoholic for decades. In the dream I hugged him in greeting and he clung to me, crying. He was cold, very cold, and I brought him to an island and abandoned him. It's a shitty dream. And real life is worse.
about hour of sleep left to me before I wake my brother for school, I should go and try to sleep. I'm doing that thing where I fixedly refuse to cry, tears don't leave my eyes but my nose drips.

He's such a sweet man, almost like a stepdad to me. The only man that my mom speaks of when she talks of love, and she left him. Mostly over the alcoholism, although maybe something else. He's so kind, and so lonely, and I feel helpless. Far away from him, and haven't spoken since I was a teen. The alcohol, he isn't a mean or rowdy drunk. Just a very chronic and sincere one.
I think I'll go now.

weir 02-Oct-20 02:05 PM
He's a kind man, don't know if he's a good one. I think I pity him, can't hate him, but I would hate myself for doing such a thing, drinking like that. Two children, one slightly estranged. A divorce, an empty house. Yard that he doesn't keep nice. He loves children and dogs. I gave him my cat, black and white, she's his cat now, still alive, she outlasted the dog. Don't know how to tell you what he is, he's a person. He gave me a french fry once, at a restaurant when I was small. He was someone we knew before my parents split, a possible outlet or catalyst, "emotional affair." I don't blame him for it. One of two men I had ever seen my mother very happy to speak to, upon first meeting. I was a kid, really a kid. Remember the feeling I got on each of the instances, disapproval, maybe fear. The other conversation that made her happy like this I had thought was a stranger at first, but he later turned out to be my grandfather, unexpectedly seen at a social function after years of no communication between them at all. I'm unsure how to proceed. These are all details, his place within the picture, but not a picture of him.
He's the one who told me about computers and silicon, binary. And the one with probable Aspergers. He's completely and utterly sincere at all times, and I don't know which is his personality and which is the drink. Used to go to his house and watch movies, he'd give us icecream bars wrapped in foil. He left three bowls of chocolate on the counter, different types of chocolate chips. He said it was an experiment to see which would evaporate faster. Took me to hockey practice, bought me McDonalds beforehand.
He got in trouble with my mom for the way he drove, it scared her. He was a sensible driver, not fast or anything. But he'd "check the steering," call it "wiggle wiggle" and basically do just that with the car.
She told him off over it, so I remember when he drove me to hockey that one time, he was telling me how he was a chauffeur or something, that he had to be very careful with me.
He eats extremely spicy peppers, vodka waterbottle in the center console of his car.

I changed the pdf to a .txt file lol. Probably not good for papers, but for longer things it's not bad. There's likely a way to format it properly. I'm going to keep trying, see if I can get a functional solution.
It totally looks like an old video game.
.txt is not good for papers because it kills images, going to do the same thing in a few different formats though. You can ctrl a then ctrl c an entire pdf, hundreds of pages of it even. It'll keep everything, font, images. If you then stick that in Word, make a .dox I think it might format pretty well, keep the images. Will try it later.
.docx I mean
Think you can export from a google doc as a .docx as well.

I think much of knowledge, science and philosophy can be reduced to observing repeated movements
and creating things, non-moving stable things, representations, that somehow maps the movement
Energy for example
The sensory experiences this concept emerges from are all movements, pressure
When we imagine that movement is a thing, we call it energy
When we see many things move towards a certain point in space, we call it an attractor, imagine that there's an invisible object at the point
Same if things move away from a point
I think all the experimental evidence of electrons is things moving in a pattern as if there's a little thing with charge
but what we observe is just movement
It's hard to distinguish between movement and matter, time and space
the most satisfying I've found is to say that space is what you can look at several times
a detachment of the object from the observer, so you can look at it several times, at will
the opposite being something you only experience as it happens, looking at it again is impossible
So it follows that if a movement recurs with enough regularity, it enters the former category, no longer a "movement". Although these terms are confusing
I should call the two categories something else, something deeper than movement, matter, time, etc

maybe 'thing' and 'place' are too high level, colloquial, not meaningful on a deeper level
maybe there are only thresholds
if you have two thresholds in opposite directions, that forms a line segment
Each threshold divides an infinite line into interior and exterior
if you have a bunch thresholds at different angles, with interiors facing each other, that's a place

places expand far around you
reminds me of something, like an algorithm that's learning the definition of a set, but it's expanding all the time, learning more. But that doesn't have the right essence.
they expand far around you. you? the landmark? but the point is that the edges are uncertain, with places
but things, those have very distinct edges

is an emotion a place

Knowing something enough to where you can ask questions about it
the phone book in a stack
To ask what color it is, you must be able to find it, check, must know where it is
It must have a known location relative to a known landmark, or it must have known edges
Either will do
Known location lets you trace a trajectory from the landmark and check what color is at that location
Known edges lets you search at random until you recognize it
then you can check what's inside the edges, at a particular location, or check a quality like color

Avatar
weir 03-Oct-20 03:11 PM
yeah
edges, I'm not entirely sure how I'm using it
was intuitive, an empty word I'm trying to fill up by extracting from examples
access is important
a thing is something you can separate from the surrounding frame, in your head, I mean
a nose is a thing
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 03:13 PM
yes
so it's invariant to method of access
you can use various access procedures, look in various places
find 'nose' more than one place
dinstinction (which I think is the general term for what you mean by edge) is non-local
access is space
But it's inevitably complicated, like, learning to know an object is also to split it into access and distinction
To learn what a computer is, you learn that it must have a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse
These are distinctions
But various computers can have very different looking monitors, keyboards

what makes a nose a nose, animals have noses, people have noses
if I have to type nose one more time it will lose all meaning as a word
want to think about it in terms of sets
the idea of a nose becomes a place if you linger too long, edges getting blurry
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 03:17 PM
words are carried by many different cognitive underpinnings
a nose is something that looks a certain way, etc
two holes next to each other under a hood, cannals going up in under it
but it's also what's between the eyes, a bit below
above the mouth
But what distinguishes it, its face, its quality, is really the locations of things in its space
if the edges of the nostrils and the nasal bone and the skin all move too much within the space of the nose
it stops being a nose
Like shuffling the letters of a word

fake noses, what about them
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 03:21 PM
on the immediate scale they are noses. But when you look at the individual parts
you see the skin is plastic
which means its internal space is organized differently, we register it as texture and color
Avatar
weir 03-Oct-20 03:22 PM
plaster noses, images of noses, cartoon noses where they are drawn as a dot or a line
these belong to the set of noses, which has become a place without edges, only a center
or a landmark, at least
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 03:23 PM
why become a place without edges
Avatar
weir 03-Oct-20 03:24 PM
because you can invent new noses, add them to the set
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 03:24 PM
but inventing a nose means arranging parts in the right configuration, so they fit the distinguishing criteria
one criterion is lost, or loosened, that the material must be organic

is the idea of a nose a thing or a place, that's what I'm trying to discover

By nose is a place, you mean nose is defined by structure, where the parts are relative to each other?
i.e. if the two holes are vertical to each other, it's not a nose
Avatar
weir 03-Oct-20 03:36 PM
the SET of nose is things that could be considered noses
and this would be based on certain criteria
but the question is, how loose?
is a representation of a nose a nose?
or is a horse nose a nose?
a place has no real edges, can expand indefinitely but is instead defined by its landmark (s)
thinking of this like trying to explain a nose to a machine, and at some point you go "good enough"
so if it's on a face in the right spot, or it visually resembles a nose, or it's used for breathing by a crocodile or duck
then it belongs to the set called noses

Sets are abstractions over rules, rules are abstractions of discriminative performance that changes through time
what a nose is depends on the situation
concepts are tools to distinguish what needs to be distinguished in a given situation
or to share recipies, descriptions of paths and where to find things
There's a book, an anthology of essays on this
"gradience in meaning, word classes and syntax. Issues such as how many grains make a heap, when a puddle becomes a pond, and so forth, have occupied thinkers since Aristotle and, since the 1980s, have been the subject of increasing interest among linguists as well as in fields such as artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. "
http://library.lol/main/E174E92BDEF5AD3BBE4E29427C20391F
I haven't read it yet, but I have wanted to for a long time
It even deals with "nouniness"
which I guess is a linguistic treatment of what it means to be a thing
it might deal with locatives too, which would be relevant to the question of what a place is

Bergson talks about sources of error
the first is mistaking a bad problem for a good problem
The problem of noses is decidedly not a beautiful problem
at least not from where we stand right now
We must take an artistic approach
Can you make your mind receptive to spontaneous thoughts and keep it in that state until a beautiful problem pops into it?
not go into any question that comes, not elaborate on them, just look at them
and evaluate them, are they beautiful?
Are they sufficiently beautiful to seduce you
Or are they a bit boring, not quite healthy
and keep this distance until a beautiful and whole problem finds you
And then show me
Will you do that?

it's a wonder, I don't understand it, but I like it
I know!
that's the thing though
the tomato
"Overripe tomato. Granular, dry. Markov blankets. Needs more entropy, water unbound."
but then
the number of microstates in a macrostate
the tomato is the macrostate
it was juicy once but then the sea became particulate, contained within cells
no longer a flavorful monolith
"More complex. More microstates, just bigger this time. Scaling up, breaking down, the macrostate is the frame."
"Movement and stability. Movement melting and scattering matter"
that's it, what I had written
Avatar
bjorn96 03-Oct-20 04:14 PM
I have several thoughts on it
One is, we must distinghuish 'is' from 'becomes'
they are opposite I think
Complexity is stability within a limited state, which seen from outside, is rigidness, lack of potential to become other things
So Complexity tends to not become complexity
Often obsolete complexity fails to become useful complexity, overspecialized too early
And entropy, it is maximally capable of becoming things
because it has no resistance, no ability to maintain itself
In this way, the potential of each is the actual of the other
The potential of Chaos is infinite different forms of Order
the potential of Order is nothing, which is to say nothing meaningful, which is Chaos
And the other thought, another angle on the same. When something is mixed, homogenous, indistinct, like ocean
It means every kind of element is present everywhere
so every little patch contains all the constituents that make up the whole
At least it tends towards this
So each little patch is a model of the whole cosmos
when entropy is high
This is like the artistic, diffuse phase of thinking. We aren't specific, but we somehow approach the whole. We don't make progress on any specific problem, but we're in the presence of a thought development that goes over years, centuries, millennia
When an idea is beautiful, rather than exact, it's because it's a model of the whole, has all the constituents of the whole. It's like this when it emerges from a mind that is more like ocean than land, without boundaries, entropic
That's my thoughts on it

exploding into being, violently
spreading over space, undergoing change
energy is mass times the speed of light in a vacuum squared
and thus nothing is lost
but this is untrue
because energy expended changes the unchanging and thus becomes time
and so energy is lost, a sacrifice, a suicide
leaving behind things suddenly more complex
stars exploding, forming elements

these relations of necessity form complex tissues, organs and organisms
they are agents have wills
perhaps they're the only thing with will

relations of necessity
so good

the problem, I find, with some ideas, some words, is that they describe a part as though it is the whole
