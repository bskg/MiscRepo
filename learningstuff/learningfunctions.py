# apparently this is a comment?
def function1 ():
    print("yes this is a function")
    print("remember it could be named something else")
print("this is outside the function")
#this saves something for later. Later looks like this:
#"function1 ()"
#okay it worked
# I should number all my comments this is super messy.
# if I get jupyter (do I have it?) then I can do multiple boxes in one window
renamed = function1
#can I rename the function? the way variables are renamed?? I'll find out.
#testing, get "this is outside the function"
renamed 
#seems to do nothing, parentheses are important for this
renamed ()
#that worked
